	abstract = {A wide range of modelling algorithms is used by ecologists, conservation practitioners, and others to predict species ranges from point locality data. Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions, making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of these algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address this need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms with independent presence–absence data from multiple species and regions. We evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46 species (from six different regions of the world) at three sample sizes (100, 30, and 10 records). We used data from natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}). With decreasing sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across species and between models. Novel modelling methods that incorporate both interactions between predictor variables and complex response shapes (i.e. {GBM}, {MARS}-{INT}, {BRUTO}) performed better than most methods at large sample sizes but not at the smallest sample sizes. Other algorithms were much less sensitive to sample size, including an algorithm based on maximum entropy ({MAXENT}) that had among the best predictive power across all sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms, a distance metric algorithm ({DOMAIN}) and a genetic algorithm ({OM}-{GARP}) had intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among the best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm predicted consistently well with small sample size (n {\textless} 30) and this should encourage highly conservative use of predictions based on small sample size and restrict their use to exploratory modelling.},

	abstract = {Aim Species distribution models and geographical information system ({GIS}) technologies are becoming increasingly important tools in conservation planning and decision-making. Often the rich data bases of museums and herbaria serve as the primary data for predicting species distributions. Yet key assumptions about the primary data often are untested, and violation of such assumptions may have consequences for model predictions. For example, users of primary data assume that sampling has been random with respect to geography and environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the assumption that plant voucher specimens adequately sample the climatic gradient and test whether violation of this assumption influences model predictions.Location Bolivia and Ecuador.Methods Using 323,711 georeferenced herbarium collections and nine climatic variables, we predicted the distribution of 76 plant species using maximum entropy models ({MAXENT}) with training points that sampled the climate environments randomly and training points that reflected the climate bias in the herbarium collections. To estimate the distribution of species, {MAXENT} finds the distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. closest to uniform) subject to the constraint that the expected value for each environmental variable under the estimated distribution matches its empirical average. The experimental design included species that differed in geographical range and elevation; all species were modelled with 20 and 100 training points. We examined the influence of the number of training points and climate bias in training points, elevation and range size on model performance using analysis of variance models.Results We found that significant parts of the climatic gradient were poorly represented in herbarium collections for both countries. For the most part, existing climatic bias in collections did not greatly affect distribution predictions when compared with an unbiased data set. Although the effects of climate bias on prediction accuracy were found to be greater where geographical ranges were characterized by high spatial variation in the degree of climate bias (i.e. ranges where the bias of the various climates sampled by collections deviated considerably from the mean bias), the greatest influence on model performance was the number of presence points used to train the model.Main conclusions These results demonstrate that predictions of species distributions can be quite good despite existing climatic biases in primary data found in natural history collections, if a sufficiently large number of training points is available. Because of consistent overprediction of models, these results also confirm the importance of validating models with independent data or expert opinion. Failure to include independent model validation, especially in cases where training points are limited, may potentially lead to grave errors in conservation decision-making and planning.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modelling has been widely applied in order to assess the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Many methodological decisions, taken during the modelling process and forecasts, may, however, lead to a large variability in the assessment of future impacts. Using measures of species range change and turnover, the potential impacts of climate change on French stream fish species and assemblages were evaluated. Our main focus was to quantify the uncertainty in the projections of these impacts arising from four sources of uncertainty: initial datasets (Data), statistical methods [species distribution models ({SDM})], general circulation models ({GCM}), and gas emission scenarios ({GES}). Several modalities of the aforementioned uncertainty sources were combined in an ensemble forecasting framework resulting in 8400 different projections. The variance explained by each source was then extracted from this whole ensemble of projections. Overall, {SDM} contributed to the largest variation in projections, followed by {GCM}, whose contribution increased over time equalling almost the proportion of variance explained by {SDM} in 2080. Data and {GES} had little influence on the variability in projections. Future projections of range change were more consistent for species with a large geographical extent (i.e., distribution along latitudinal or stream gradients) or with restricted environmental requirements (i.e., small thermal or elevation ranges). Variability in projections of turnover was spatially structured at the scale of France, indicating that certain particular geographical areas should be considered with care when projecting the potential impacts of climate change. The results of this study, therefore, emphasized that particular attention should be paid to the use of predictions ensembles resulting from the application of several statistical methods and climate models. Moreover, forecasted impacts of climate change should always be provided with an assessment of their uncertainty, so that management and conservation decisions can be taken in the full knowledge of their reliability.},

	abstract = {1. Relationships between probabilities of occurrence for fifteen diadromous fish species and environmental variables characterising their habitat in fluvial waters were explored using an extensive collection of distributional data from New Zealand rivers and streams. Environmental predictors were chosen for their likely functional relevance, and included variables describing conditions in the stream segment where sampling occurred, downstream factors affecting the ability of fish to move upriver from the sea, and upstream, catchment-scale factors mostly affecting variation in river flows. 2. Analyses were performed using multivariate adaptive regression splines ({MARS}), a technique that uses piece-wise linear segments to describe non-linear relationships between species and environmental variables. All species were analysed using an option that allows simultaneous analysis of community data to identify the combination of environmental variables best able to predict the occurrence of the component species. Model discrimination was assessed for each species using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC}) statistic, calculated using a bootstrap procedure that estimates performance when predictions are made to independent data. 3. Environmental predictors having the strongest overall relationships with probabilities of occurrence included distance from the sea, stream size, summer temperature, and catchment-scale drivers of variation in stream flow. Many species were also sensitive to variation in either the average and/or maximum downstream slope, and riparian shade was an important predictor for some species. 4. Analysis results were imported into a Geographic Information System where they were combined with extensive environmental data, allowing spatially explicit predictions of probabilities of occurrence by species to be made for New Zealand's entire river network. This information will provide a valuable context for future conservation management in New Zealand's rivers and streams.},

These data and profile techniques can be used to generate species distribution models ({SDMs}), but pseudo-absences must be generated to use group discriminative techniques. In this study, we evaluated whether the {SDMs} generated with pseudo-absences are reliable and also if there are differences in the results obtained with profile and group discriminative techniques. Location  Ecuador, South America. Methods  The {SDMs} were generated with a training data set for each of the five species of Anthurium and six different methods: two profile techniques ({BIOCLIM} and Gower’s distance index), three group discriminative techniques [logistic multiple regression ({LMR}), multivariate adaptative regression splines ({MARS}) and Maxent] and a mixed modelling approach genetic algorithm for rule-set production ({GARP}), which employs a combination of profile and group discriminative techniques and generates its own pseudo-absences. For {LMR}, {MARS} and Maxent, three types of absences were generated: (1) random pseudo-absences in equal number to presences and excluding a buffer area around presences (except for Maxent, which assumes that this background sample includes presences), (2) a large number (10,000) of random pseudo-absences, also excluding a buffer area around each presence and (3) ‘target-group absences’ ({TGA}), consisting of sites where other species of the group have been collected by the specialist, but not the species being modelled. To compare the predictive performance of the {SDMs}, the area under the curve statistic was calculated using an independent testing data set for each species. Results  {MARS}, Maxent and {LMR} produce better results than the profile techniques. The models created with {TGA} are generally more accurate than those generated with pseudo-absences. Main conclusions  The advantages and disadvantages of different options for using pseudo-absences and {TGA} with profile and group discriminative modelling techniques are explained and recommendations are made for the future.},

	abstract = {We examine the consequences of restricting the range of environmental conditions over which niche-based models are developed to project potential future distributions of three selected European tree species to assess first, the importance of removing absences beyond species known distributions (“naughty noughts”) and second the importance of capturing the full environmental range of species. We found that restricting the environmental range of data strongly influenced the estimation of response curves, especially towards upper and lower ends of environmental ranges. This induces changes in the probability values towards upper and lower environmental boundaries, leading to more conservative scenarios in terms of changes in distribution projections. Using restricted data analogous to not capturing the fun species’ environmental range, reduces strongly the combinations of environmental conditions under which the models are calibrated, and reduces the applicability of the models for predictive purposes. This may generate unpredictable effects on the tails of the species response curves, yielding spurious projections into the future provided that probability of occurrence is not set to zero outside the environmental limits of the species. Indeed, as the restricted data does not capture the whole of the response curve, projections of future species distributions based of ecological niche modelling may be only valid if niche models are able to approach the complete response curve of environmental predictors.},

	abstract = {Statistical modeling of areas of distribution of species by correlative analysis of the environmental features of known presences has become widespread. However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches.},

However, limited available data and the lack of reliable absence data have become a major challenge to overcome. At least two approaches have been proposed to generate pseudo-absences; however it is not clear how the number of pseudo-absences created affect model performance. Moreover, the spatial bias in the collecting localities of a species (presence data) may add extra noise to the final distribution model. Here, we use a virtual species to assess the effects of spatial sampling bias, and number and location of pseudo-absences on model accuracy. We found that both number of pseudo-absences and spatial bias in sampling localities, as well as their interaction, significantly influence all accuracy measures ({AUC}, sensitivity, and specificity). However, location of pseudo-absences (either generated across the entire study area or only outside the environmental envelope of the species) does not affect model performance. These results provide some methodological guidelines for developing reliable distribution hypotheses when presence data are scarce.},

Next, we added pseudo-absence data generated by different sampling designs and in different numbers to assess their relative importance for the output from the species distribution model. The sampling design strongly influenced the predictive performance of the models while the number of pseudo-absences had minimal effect on the predictive performance. We attribute much of these results to the relationship between the environmental range of the pseudo-absences (i.e. the extent of the environmental space being considered) and the environmental range of the presence observations (i.e. under which environmental conditions the species occurs). The number of generated pseudo-absences had a direct effect on the predicted probability, which translated to different distribution areas. Pseudo-absence observations that fell within grid cells with presence observations were purposely included in our analyses.

	abstract = {* {1Few} examples of habitat-modelling studies of rare and endangered species exist in the literature, although from a conservation perspective predicting their distribution would prove particularly useful. Paucity of data and lack of valid absences are the probable reasons for this shortcoming. Analytic solutions to accommodate the lack of absence include the ecological niche factor analysis ({ENFA)} and the use of generalized linear models ({GLM)} with simulated pseudo-absences. * {2In} this study we tested a new approach to generating pseudo-absences, based on a preliminary {ENFA} habitat suitability ({HS)} map, for the endangered species Eryngium alpinum. This method of generating pseudo-absences was compared with two others: (i) use of a {GLM} with pseudo-absences generated totally at random, and (ii) use of an {ENFA} only. * {3The} influence of two different spatial resolutions (i.e. grain) was also assessed for tackling the dilemma of quality (grain) vs. quantity (number of occurrences). Each combination of the three above-mentioned methods with the two grains generated a distinct {HS} map. * {4Four} evaluation measures were used for comparing these {HS} maps: total deviance explained, best kappa, Gini coefficient and minimal predicted area ({MPA).} The last is a new evaluation criterion proposed in this study. * {5Results} showed that (i) {GLM} models using {ENFA-weighted} pseudo-absence provide better results, except for the {MPA} value, and that (ii) quality (spatial resolution and locational accuracy) of the data appears to be more important than quantity (number of occurrences). Furthermore, the proposed {MPA} value is suggested as a useful measure of model evaluation when used to complement classical statistical measures. * {6Synthesis} and applications. We suggest that the use of {ENFA-weighted} pseudo-absence is a possible way to enhance the quality of {GLM-based} potential distribution maps and that data quality (i.e. spatial resolution) prevails over quantity (i.e. number of data). Increased accuracy of potential distribution maps could help to define better suitable areas for species protection and reintroduction.},

	abstract = {* {1Model-based} approaches have been used increasingly in conservation biology over recent years. Species presence data used for predictive species distribution modelling are abundant in natural history collections, whereas reliable absence data are sparse, most notably for vagrant species such as butterflies and snakes. As predictive methods such as generalized linear models ({GLM)} require absence data, various strategies have been proposed to select pseudo-absence data. However, only a few studies exist that compare different approaches to generating these pseudo-absence data. * {2Natural} history collection data are usually available for long periods of time (decades or even centuries), thus allowing historical considerations. However, this historical dimension has rarely been assessed in studies of species distribution, although there is great potential for understanding current patterns, i.e. the past is the key to the present. * {3We} used {GLM} to model the distributions of three ‘target’ butterfly species, Melitaea didyma, Coenonympha tullia and Maculinea teleius, in Switzerland. We developed and compared four strategies for defining pools of pseudo-absence data and applied them to natural history collection data from the last 10, 30 and 100 years. Pools included: (i) sites without target species records; (ii) sites where butterfly species other than the target species were present; (iii) sites without butterfly species but with habitat characteristics similar to those required by the target species; and (iv) a combination of the second and third strategies. Models were evaluated and compared by the total deviance explained, the maximized Kappa and the area under the curve ({AUC).} * {4Among} the four strategies, model performance was best for strategy 3. Contrary to expectations, strategy 2 resulted in even lower model performance compared with models with pseudo-absence data simulated totally at random (strategy 1). * {5Independent} of the strategy model, performance was enhanced when sites with historical species presence data were not considered as pseudo-absence data. Therefore, the combination of strategy 3 with species records from the last 100 years achieved the highest model performance. * {6Synthesis} and applications. The protection of suitable habitat for species survival or reintroduction in rapidly changing landscapes is a high priority among conservationists. Model-based approaches offer planning authorities the possibility of delimiting priority areas for species detection or habitat protection. The performance of these models can be enhanced by fitting them with pseudo-absence data relying on large archives of natural history collection species presence data rather than using randomly sampled pseudo-absence data.},

	abstract = {Modelling species distributions with presence data from atlases, museum collections and databases is challenging. In this paper, we compare seven procedures to generate pseudo-absence data, which in turn are used to generate {GLM}-logistic regressed models when reliable absence data are not available. We use pseudo-absences selected randomly or by means of presence-only methods ({ENFA} and {MDE}) to model the distribution of a threatened endemic Iberian moth species (Graellsia isabelae). The results show that the pseudo-absence selection method greatly influences the percentage of explained variability, the scores of the accuracy measures and, most importantly, the degree of constraint in the distribution estimated. As we extract pseudo-absences from environmental regions further from the optimum established by presence data, the models generated obtain better accuracy scores, and over-prediction increases. When variables other than environmental ones influence the distribution of the species (i.e., non-equilibrium state) and precise information on absences is non-existent, the random selection of pseudo-absences or their selection from environmental localities similar to those of species presence data generates the most constrained predictive distribution maps, because pseudo-absences can be located within environmentally suitable areas. This study shows that if we do not have reliable absence data, the method of pseudo-absence selection strongly conditions the obtained model, generating different model predictions in the gradient between potential and realized distributions.},

	abstract = {Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDM)} are commonly used to obtain hypotheses on either the realized or the potential distribution of species. The reliability and meaning of these hypotheses depends on the kind of absences included in the training data, the variables used as predictors and the methods employed to parameterize the models. Information about the absence of species from certain localities is usually lacking, so pseudo-absences are often incorporated to the training data. We explore the effect of using different kinds of pseudo-absences on {SDM} results. To do this, we use presence information on Aphodius bonvouloiri, a dung beetle species of well-known distribution. We incorporate different types of pseudo-absences to create different sets of training data that account for absences of methodological (i.e. false absences), contingent and environmental origin. We used these datasets to calibrate {SDMs} with {GAMs} as modelling technique and climatic variables as predictors, and compare these results with geographical representations of the potential and realized distribution of the species created independently. Our results confirm the importance of the kind of absences in determining the aspect of species distribution identified through {SDM.} Estimations of the potential distribution require absences located farther apart in the geographic and/or environmental space than estimations of the realized distribution. Methodological absences produce overall bad models, and absences that are too far from the presence points in either the environmental or the geographic space may not be informative, yielding important overestimations. {GLMs} and Artificial Neural Networks yielded similar results. Synthetic discrimination measures such as the Area Under the Receiver Characteristic Curve ({AUC)} must be interpreted with caution, as they can produce misleading comparative results. Instead, the joint examination of ommission and comission errors provides a better understanding of the reliability of {SDM} results.},

	abstract = {A consortium of 16 laboratories have studied chloroplast {DNA} ({cpDNA)} variation in European white oaks. A common strategy for molecular screening, based on restriction analysis of four {PCR-amplified} {cpDNA} fragments, was used to allow comparison among the different laboratories. A total of 2613 oak populations (12,214 individual trees from eight species) were sampled from 37 countries, and analysed with the four fragments. They belong to eight related oak species: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. frainetto, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. canariensis and Q. macranthera. During this survey, 45 chloroplast variants were detected and are described together with their phylogenetic relationships, but several of these haplotypes were pooled when there were some risks of confusion across laboratories during the survey, and finally 32 remained that were mapped and used in diversity analyses. A strong phylogeographic structure is apparent from the data, where related haplotypes have broadly similar geographic distributions. In total, six {cpDNA} lineages are identified, which have distinct geographic distributions, mainly along a longitudinal gradient. Most haplotypes found in northern Europe are also present in the south, whereas the converse is not true, suggesting that the majority of mutations observed were generated prior to postglacial recolonisation, corroborating the conclusions of earlier studies. The description of a new western European lineage constitutes a major finding, compared to earlier phylogenetic treatments. Although the eight oak species studied systematically share {cpDNA} variants when in sympatry, they partition {cpDNA} diversity differently, as a consequence of their different ecology and life history attributes. Regional differences in levels of differentiation also exist (either species-specific or general); these seem to be related to the intensity of past and present management of the forests across Europe but also to the level of fragmentation of the range within these regions.},

We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental {data.Location} Europe, North America and South {America.Methods} The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive {species.Results} We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting {results.Main} conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.},

The evolution of climatic tolerances in Anogra + Kleinia has been heterogeneous, across phylogenetic groups and across different dimensions of climate. All the extant taxa occur in semiarid to arid conditions (annual precipitation of 10.1-49.1 cm and high temperatures in the warmest month of 28.5 degrees-40.1 degrees C), but there is striking variation among taxa in their climatic tolerances, especially temperature (minimum temperatures in the coldest month of -14.0 degrees to 5.3 degrees C) and summer versus winter precipitation (precipitation in the warmest quarter of 0.6-19.4 cm). Climatic disparity is especially pronounced in two subclades (californica, deltoides) that radiated in the southwestern United States and California, apparently including both divergent and convergent evolution of climatic tolerances. This niche evolution is remarkable, given the probable timescale of the radiation (approximately 1 million years). We suggest that the spatiotemporal climatic heterogeneity of western North America has served as a driver of diversification. Our data are also consistent with Axelrod's hypothesis that the spread of arid conditions in western North America stimulated diversification of arid-adapted lineages.},

	abstract = {Aim To assess the effect of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity on the potential distribution of species under future climate changes. Trees may be adapted to specific climatic conditions; however, species range predictions have classically been assessed by species distribution models ({SDMs)} that do not account for intra-specific genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, because {SDMs} rely on the assumption that species respond homogeneously to climate change across their range, i.e. a species is equally adapted throughout its range, and all species are equally plastic. These assumptions could cause {SDMs} to exaggerate or underestimate species at risk under future climate {change.Location} The Iberian {Peninsula.Methods} Species distributions are predicted by integrating experimental data and modelling techniques. We incorporate plasticity and local adaptation into a {SDM} by calibrating models of tree survivorship with adaptive traits in provenance trials. Phenotypic plasticity was incorporated by calibrating our model with a climatic index that provides a measure of the differences between sites and {provenances.Results} We present a new modelling approach that is easy to implement and makes use of existing tree provenance trials to predict species distribution models under global warming. Our results indicate that the incorporation of intra-population genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in {SDMs} significantly altered their outcome. In comparing species range predictions, the decrease in area occupancy under global warming conditions is smaller when considering our survival–adaptation model than that predicted by a ‘classical {SDM’} calibrated with presence–absence data. These differences in survivorship are due to both local adaptation and plasticity. Differences due to the use of experimental data in the model calibration are also expressed in our results: we incorporate a null model that uses survival data from all provenances together. This model always predicts less reduction in area occupancy for both species than the {SDM} calibrated with {presence–absence.Main} conclusions We reaffirm the importance of considering adaptive traits when predicting species distributions and avoiding the use of occurrence data as a predictive variable. In light of these recommendations, we advise that existing predictions of future species distributions and their component populations must be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances. Current models of spatially varying selection could be made more realistic by the incorporation of strong selection and isolation-by-distance characteristic of tree populations. Many studies suggest that most variation in adaptive traits is based on loci with small effects. Association genetics methods and improved genomic resources are useful for the identification of the loci responsible for this variation. The potential for adaptation to current climate change depends on genetic variation and dispersal and establishment rates.},

The functions predict 13 year height from climate: degree-days {\textgreater} 5 {°C;} mean annual temperature; degree-days {\textless} 0 {°C;} summer-winter temperature differential; and a moisture index, the ratio of degree-days {\textgreater} 5 {°C} to mean annual precipitation. Validation of the response functions with two sets of independent data produced for all functions statistically significant simple correlations with coefficients as high as 0.81 between actual and predicted heights. The response functions described the widely different growth potentials typical of natural populations and demonstrated that these growth potentials have different climatic optima. Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climates colder than their optima, with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climates becoming greater as the climate becomes more severe. When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center, the functions described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effects that were geographically complex. The short-term effects should be negative in the warmest climates but strongly positive in the coldest. Long-term effects eventually should ameliorate the negative short-term impacts, enhance the positive, and in time, substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forests of Eurasia. Realizing the long-term gains will require redistribution of genotypes across the landscape, a process that should take up to 13 generations and therefore many years.},

	abstract = {Several studies have observed that taxa below the level of species can vary in the degree to which they differ from one another in the environmental space they occupy. These patterns of within-species niche variation raise the question of whether these differences should be considered when developing models for predicting the potential effects of climate change on species distributions. We address this question with two divergent datasets, one on sister species and subspecies from the European herpetofauna, the other on subspecies of breeding birds in North America. Atlas and observation data come from the Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles in Europe and the North American Breeding Bird Survey, respectively. We develop boosted regression tree models of climate–distribution relationships and project the predicted geographic range of each taxon using interpolated weather station data and modeled climate for the year 2080. We find differences between models that distinguish the contributions of subtaxa and those that do not, in terms of prediction of both current and future distributions. In comparison to models that ignore sub-taxon structure, models that incorporate this structure generally predict larger areas of suitable conditions, consistently perform better, if only marginally, as measured by cross-validated {AUC}, and can reveal divergent potential effects of climate change on subtaxa. Differences in niche occupancy and predicted distribution appear between closely related taxa regardless of their phylogenetic distinctness. For these reasons, information on subtaxon membership and phylogeographic structure should be included in modeling exercises when available, in order to identify both the contribution of these units to the niche occupancy of species and the potentially distinct responses of subtaxa to climate change.},

Restoration is needed; however, no information regarding the degree of local adaptation is available to guide these efforts. A seedling common-garden experiment was employed to assess genetic diversity and geographic differentiation (Q({ST))} of whitebark pine for traits involved in growth and adaptation to cold and to determine climatic variables revealing local adaptation. Seedlings from 48 populations were grown for two years and measured for height increment, biomass, root to shoot ratio, date of needle flush, fall and spring cold injury, and survival. Significant variation was observed among populations for most traits. The Q({ST)} was low (0.07-0.14) for growth traits and moderate (0.36-0.47) for cold adaptation related traits, but varied by region. Cold adaptation traits were strongly correlated with mean temperature of the coldest month of population origins, while growth traits were generally correlated with growing season length. We recommend that seed transfer for restoration favor seed movement from milder to colder climates to a maximum of {1.9°C} in mean annual temperature in the northern portion of the species range, and {1.0°C} in the U. S. Rocky Mountains to avoid maladaptation to current conditions yet facilitate adaptation to future climates.},

	abstract = {The geographic distribution throughout Europe of each of 32 chloroplast {DNA} variants belonging to eight white oak species sampled from 2613 populations is presented. Clear-cut geographic patterns were revealed by the survey. These distributions, together with the available palynological information, were used to infer colonisation routes out of the glacial period refugia. In western Europe in particular, movements out of the Iberian and the Italian Peninsulas can be clearly identified. Separate refugia are also present in eastern Balkans, whereas further west in this peninsula similarities with Italy were evident. Movements resulting in the exchange of haplotypes between refugia both during the present interglacial and probably also during earlier glacial cycles were therefore inferred. The consequences of these past exchanges is that phylogenetically divergent haplotypes have sometimes followed very similar colonisation routes, limiting somewhat the phylogeographic structure. Cases of geographic disjunction in the present-day distribution of haplotypes are also apparent and could have been induced by the existence of rapid climatic changes at the end of the glacial period (specifically the Younger Dryas cold period), which resulted in range restriction following an early warm period during which oak first expanded from its primary refugia. This cold phase was followed by a new period of expansion at the outset of the Holocene, involving in some cases ‘secondary’ refugia. It is expected that these short climate oscillations would have led to a partial reshuffling of haplotype distribution. Early association between haplotypes and oak species are also suggested by the data, although extensive introgression among species has ultimately largely blurred the pattern. This implies that colonisation routes may have been initially constrained by the ecological characteristics of the species hosting each chloroplast variant. We suggest for instance that two oak species distributed in the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Quercus petraea and Q. pubescens) are recent post-glacial immigrants there. When considered together, conclusions on the location of glacial period refugia and the colonisation routes derived from molecular information and fossil pollen data appear to be both largely compatible and complementary.},

	abstract = {In this study, we explore the interplay of population demography with the evolution of ecological niches during or after speciation in Hordeum. While large populations maintain a high level of standing genetic diversity, gene flow and recombination buffers against fast alterations in ecological adaptation. Small populations harbour lower allele diversity but can more easily shift to new niches if they initially survive under changed conditions. Thus, large populations should be more conservative regarding niche changes in comparison to small populations. We used environmental niche modelling together with phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to infer the correlation of population demography with changes in ecological niche dimensions in 12 diploid Hordeum species from the New World, forming four monophyletic groups. Our analyses found both shifts and conservatism in distinct niche dimensions within and among clades. Speciation due to vicariance resulted in three species with no pronounced climate niche differences, while species originating due to long-distance dispersals or otherwise encountering genetic bottlenecks mostly revealed climate niche shifts. Niche convergence among clades indicates a niche-filling pattern during the last 2 million years in South American Hordeum. We provide evidence that species, which did not encounter population reductions mainly showed ecoclimatic niche conservatism, while major niche shifts occurred in species which have undergone population bottlenecks. Our data allow the conclusion that population demography influences adaptation and niche shifts or conservatism in South American Hordeum species.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate whether a correlation exists between maternal lineage, assessed by variation in maternally inherited chloroplast {DNA} ({cpDNA)} and nuclear controlled variation (phenotypic traits and gene markers). Variation in {cpDNA} and nuclear controlled traits (62 phenotypic traits, eight isozyme and 31 {RAPD} loci) was studied in deciduous oak trees (mostly Q. petraea) growing in 16 provenance tests. Results from two nuclear diversity studies were also included. The test for correlation was performed using two methods by: (1) comparing provenance mean values (or allele frequencies) among different lineages using {ANOVA}, (2) making pairwise comparisons of chloroplastic genetic distances ({CGDs)} with phenotypic differentiation index ({DI)} (or nuclear genetic distances ({GD))} among all provenances using the Mantel test. Among the 62 phenotypic traits, only seven exhibited significant associations with maternal lineages when tested using {ANOVA} (six using Mantel test). This number decreased to two once correction for geographic distance was introduced in the calculation for Mantel test. There were stronger correlations between maternal lineage and nuclear gene markers. The existence of cytonuclear disequilibrium was shown by the significant differences in allozyme frequencies between the four maternal lineages (at least one allele for each locus). These associations were confirmed by significant correlations between {CGD} and {GD.} Finally associations were also found between levels of diversity in nuclear markers and maternal lineages. These results are discussed in the context of the glacial and postglacial history of oak populations in Europe. The analysis suggests that the processes which led to the current structure of chloroplastic diversity and variation for phenotypic traits can be subdivided into four major phases. (1) During the last long glacial period, deciduous oaks were probably confined to three major refugia which were genetically differentiated for chloroplastic and nuclear genes. (2) At the end of the glacial period, oaks migrated northwards and established a spatial pattern of distribution for chloroplastic genes which remains largely intact to this day. (3) As oaks progressively occupied the mid and northern parts of Europe, pollen flow established communication between stands originating from eastern and western refugia. This resulted in the gradual erosion of the original nuclear differentiation while conserving the chloroplastic variation installed during colonization. (4) Local selection pressures acting on the established populations eventually caused their genetic differentiation gradually to increase with time. New patterns of differentiation now exist which are totally different from those in place immediately following colonization. During this time, chloroplastic divergence remained unchanged. These processes led to the loss of any association between chloroplastic divergence and phenotypic traits, although some association with gene markers which are less affected by selection has been retained.},

	abstract = {The geographic distribution of maternally inherited chloroplast {DNA} polymorphisms was studied to determine the phylogeographic structure of white oaks in the Iberian Peninsula. Almost 1000 mature trees from nearly 200 populations were sampled in the distribution areas of the six white oak species that are recognised in Iberia. The analysed trees roughly represent the species distribution and their respective abundance. The {PCR–RFLP} procedure used by all project partners revealed up to 14 {cpDNA} haplotypes. Seven of them had not been previously described and have not been found elsewhere in Europe. Phylogenetic relationships among the haplotypes support the existence of four maternal lineages, one of them being restricted in Europe to the Mediterranean Spain and Corsica. Genetic diversity analysis confirmed the previously described extensive sharing of haplotypes among species, but also detected some species effect in intra- and inter-specific cytoplasmic gene flow. Geographic structuration of genotypes was studied by means of autocorrelation analysis. Autocorrelation was significant for ordered and unordered alleles both when considering all populations and when analysis was restricted to lineage B. However, in both instances there was not significant autocorrelation for the contribution of the genetic divergence between haplotypes to the total coefficient of differentiation. Autocorrelograms reflect the existence of a patchy distribution of haplotypes at different scales when all lineages are considered and when only lineage B is taken into account. Finally, discussion centres on the possible role played by the Iberian Peninsula as the European westernmost refugia for the white oaks during the last glacial period. We present several lines of evidence that make us to favour the persistence of white oaks in small northern refugia during the full glacial period.},

	abstract = {Polymorphism in non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome was studied in four white oak species (Q. robur L., Q. petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Q. pubescens Willd. s.l., and Q. frainetto Ten.) in Italy (mainland and associated islands, including Corsica). A total of 924 trees (194 populations) was analysed. This data set also includes results previously obtained on 20 Italian and Corsican populations [Genetics 146 (1997) 1475]. Most of the sampled individuals were classified as Q. pubescens (73.5\%). Thirty-four populations out of 194 (17.5\%) were polymorphic. The level of population sub-division was very high, as expressed by the value of the coefficient {GST=0.870} ({hS=0.100}, {hT=0.776).} The highest value of total genetic diversity was calculated in Sardinia and in central Italy; the lowest in southern Italy. The highest values of differentiation among populations occurred in Sardinia ({GST=1)}, and in Corsica (0.927). We found evidence that the Italian oak populations of today mainly originated from Sicilian and Balkan refugia. Their origin and migration routes are more easily seen by considering data separately for the four sampling regions: the north, the centre, the south, and the three main islands. The C (=blue) lineage was common in the southern part of Italy. This may be a trace of a migration from the Balkans via the Adriatic bridge during quaternary cold periods. The northern part of the country had a set of haplotypes similar to the other Alpine regions. Most Sicilian populations are fixed for one of the two haplotypes that probably originated in the island: one spread over the whole Italian peninsula, whereas the other one did not reach the Alps. Results showed that the Appennines may have played a role in the distribution of the haplotypes western and eastern of the mountains chain.},

	abstract = {Oak chloroplast {DNA} ({cpDNA)} variation was studied in a grid-based inventory in western Central Europe, including Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, and the northern parts of Upper and Lower Austria. A total of 2155 trees representing 426 populations of Quercus robur L. and Q. petraea (Matt.) Liebl. were screened for polymorphism in up to four {PCR-amplified} {cpDNA} fragments. Eleven haplotypes belonging to four lineages were detected; these lineages were formerly restricted to glacial refugia in the Iberian Peninsula, the Apennine Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. The haplotypes originating from the Apennines are particularly well represented in the study region, but there is also a significant contribution from the other refugia, which explain the high overall level of {cpDNA} diversity. The strong human impact in western Central Europe during the past centuries, which has resulted in the clearance of most forests, was followed by reforestation, sometimes involving seed transfers. Despite this strong human impact, broad geographic patterns of lineages and haplotypes could still be detected. To evaluate further the consequences of the former human activities on the present day oak {cpDNA} genetic structure, four regions where increasingly strong human impact was anticipated (ranging from hilly regions in southern Germany to roadsides plantations in The Netherlands) were selected. There, a comparison of the levels of intrapopulation {cpDNA} diversity and spatial structuring was made. Over the whole area, within stand diversity was significantly higher in Q. robur than in Q. petraea ({hS=0.24} vs. 0.16). Since total diversity is identical for both species, this results in a significantly lower level of fixation for Q. robur than for Q. petraea ({GST=0.68} vs. 0.79). The analyses also reveal a decrease of fixation with increasing human impact on oak populations. The Dutch roadside plantations (Q. robur) exhibit a very low level of fixation ({GST=0.28)} as compared to Q. petraea in southern Germany ({GST=0.91).} The significance of the spatial genetic structure was tested using geostatistical methods. For the complete data set, a strong spatial genetic structure is confirmed, with higher than average genetic similarities between populations distant from up to 270 km, whereas there is no spatial structure in the roadside plantations in The Netherlands or in the northern German lowlands. These results should help to differentiate introduced from autochthonous populations, and provide a framework for the identification of the geographic origin of seed lots.},

The sampled trees belong to four different species (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Quercus pubescens, Quercus frainetto) and to several putative subspecies. Variation at four chloroplast {DNA} ({cpDNA)} fragments was studied using restriction enzymes, resulting in the detection of 12 haplotypes. One haplotype was present in 36\% of the trees, and six were found in 6–17\% of the trees. The haplotypes are shared extensively between species and subspecies. They belong to three different lineages (A, C and E) and are phylogeographically structured in the region investigated. Haplotypes of lineage E dominate to the east of the Carpathian mountains in Romania, whereas the Carpathian Basin seems to have been colonised along several different colonisation routes, from the Balkan peninsula but also from Italy. The data support the possible role of climatic instability during the late glacial period in shaping this complex geographic structure. The presence of several secondary refugia could be inferred in the region, which have played a major role in the second step of recolonisation, at the onset of the Holocene period.},

	abstract = {In this study we were interested how recolonisation of oak in the Baltic region occurred after the last ice-age. To analyse the chloroplast {DNA} ({cpDNA)} variation for white oak species at the more northerly limit of their distribution, a total of 394 samples from 54 locations from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland were assessed for previously characterised as well as newly found {cpDNA} variation. Of the oak samples taken, Quercus robur was most frequently found throughout the entire Baltic area. Quercus petraea was only found and characterised in Poland.
A total of 13 different haplotypes were found within the Baltic area. Most frequent (75\% of all samples) are members of lineage A (common in the Balkan refugial area) while 16\% belong to oak from the Italian Pleistocene forest refuge and only a total of 9\% originate in the Spanish refuge the majority of which is likely to be also allochtonous. Haplotype 7 of lineage A is found in 33\% of the sample set in the entire Baltic region. Haplotype 6 is found at the more northern limit of the area. Haplotype 5 a more eastern member of the lineage is found at low frequency in the east of the region. Haplotype 4, rather sparse in Europe, is mainly scattered throughout Poland. Lineage C is represented by haplotypes 1 and 2 the former found close to the Baltic Sea while the latter, being an Eastern member of the lineage originating in Italy, is found at low frequency to the east of the region. Oak from refugial areas in Spain has limited impact on the area and is found exclusively in Poland. Such genotypes are found mainly close to the Baltic Sea in Poland and only 2\% show up in uniform stands. Therefore members of lineage B could either have their most north-easterly limit of distribution in Poland or most likely they have been transferred there from possible German locations. In spite of the historical anthropogenic influences in the Baltic States as well as in Poland clear tracks of recolonisation could be identified.},

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction ({GARP).} We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analyses. The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC)} was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

	abstract = {Multiple logistic regression is precluded from many practical applications in ecology that aim to predict the geographic distributions of species because it requires absence data, which are rarely available or are unreliable. In order to use multiple logistic regression, many studies have simulated "pseudo-absences" through a number of strategies, but it is unknown how the choice of strategy influences models and their geographic predictions of species. In this paper we evaluate the effect of several prevailing pseudo-absence strategies on the predictions of the geographic distribution of a virtual species whose "true" distribution and relationship to three environmental predictors was predefined. We evaluated the effect of using a) real absences b) pseudo-absences selected randomly from the background and c) two-step approaches: pseudo-absences selected from low suitability areas predicted by either Ecological Niche Factor Analysis: ({ENFA)} or {BIOCLIM.} We compared how the choice of pseudo-absence strategy affected model fit, predictive power, and information-theoretic model selection results.

	abstract = {Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models ({SDMs}) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few {SDM} studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by {SDMs} can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the {SDMs} substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small ( 9\%) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually ( 20\% each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on {SDM} performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.},

	abstract = {One of the goals of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ({CERP}) is to restore more natural salinity regimes to the coastal bays of South Florida ({USA}) with the aim of improving their degraded estuarine function (e.g., as productive feeding and nursery areas). Here, we examined the occurrence (presence-absence) and concentration (presence-only fish density) of goldspotted killifish (Floridichthys carpio) observed in an ongoing fish survey as potential indicators of restoration performance in Biscayne Bay, Florida. To determine F. carpio salinity affinity, we applied regression analyses to field data and performed behavioral choice trials in the laboratory, whereby individuals were exposed to a salinity gradient (10-50). Analysis of field data indicated a parabolic relationship between killifish occurrence and salinity, where occurrence is maximized at salinity ∼22. Killifish concentration was unrelated to salinity. Experimental salinity choice results tended to agree with field observations of occurrence and demonstrated a preference for intermediate salinity levels (10-30). Finally, we performed a simulation exercise to compare seasonal changes in habitat suitability within our study domain over the course of one year. Seasonal comparisons were performed as a proxy for assessing different freshwater management alternatives. We applied the relationship between killifish occurrence and salinity that resulted from analyses of field data to the output of a published hydrodynamic salinity transport model. This exercise provided areal estimates of suitable habitat gained or lost, as well as maps indicating the geographic distribution of habitat quality by season. We conclude that: (1) continued field monitoring of goldspotted killifish occurrence is warranted for its utility as a biological indicator of nearshore salinity conditions in an ecosystem-based management framework and (2) the regression relationships revealed by the present study may be useful in habitat suitability modeling exercises, especially those that compare impacts of different freshwater flow scenarios via simulation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aim: Species often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models ({SDMs}) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of {SDMs}. We compare the performance of three types of {SDMs}: (1) a technique based on presence-absence data, (2) a technique based on presence-background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection. Innovation: We use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in {SDMs}. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence-absence and presence-background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables. Main conclusions: The performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an {SDM} by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for {SDM} performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the {SDM} literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Understanding species spatial occurrence patterns and their environmental dependence is one of the fundamental goals in ecology and evolution. Often, occurrence models are built with presence-only data because absence data are unavailable. We compare the strengths and limitations of the recently developed presence-only modelling method, Maxlike, with the more widely used Maxent. In spite of disparities highlighted by the developers of Maxlike and Maxent, we show approximate formal relationships between the parameters of Maxlike and Maxent for two scenarios to illustrate their similarity. Using case studies based on real and simulated data, we show how these similarities manifest in practice. We find more similarities than differences between Maxlike and Maxent, including coefficient values, predicted spatial distributions, similarity to presence-absence models, predictive performance and ranking the predicted suitability of cells. Maxlike reliably predicted absolute occurrence probabilities for very large data sets on landscapes where occurrence probability approximately spanned [0,1]. For smaller data sets, the uncertainty in predicted occurrence probability by Maxlike was very large, due to the inherent limitations of presence-only data. In contrast, Maxent is constrained to predicting relative occurrence probabilities or relative occurrence rates unless it is provided with additional information from presence-absence data. Both models can reliably predict relative differences in occurrence probability. The choice of which model to use depends partly on sampling assumptions, which we discuss in detail. Due to limitations of presence-only data, ecologists should typically focus on interpretations relying on relative differences in occurrence probability or relative occurrence rates. We discuss how to remedy a number of concerns about the use of Maxent and how to avoid some potential pitfalls with Maxlike - particularly related to high variance predictions. We conclude that both methods are similarly valuable for understanding and predicting species' distributions in terms of relative differences in occurrence probability when the models are specified carefully. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) for presence-only data depend on accurate and precise measurements of geographical and environmental covariates that influence presence and abundance of the species. Some data sets, however, may contain both systematic and random errors in the recorded location of the species. Environmental covariates at the recorded location may differ from those at the true location and result in biased parameter estimates and predictions from {SDMs}. Regression calibration is a well-developed statistical method that can be used to correct the bias in estimated coefficients and predictions from {SDMs} when the recorded geographical location differs from the true location for some, but not all locations. We expand the application of regression calibration methods to {SDMs} and provide illustrative examples using simulated data and opportunistic records of whooping cranes (Grus americana). We found we were able to successfully correct the bias in our {SDM} parameters estimated from simulated data and opportunistic records of whooping cranes using regression calibration. When modelling species distributions with data that have geographical location errors, we recommend researchers consider the effect of location errors. Correcting for location errors requires that at least a portion of the data have locations recorded without error. Bias correction can result in an increase in variance; this increase in variance should be considered when evaluating the utility of bias correction. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {The Vulnerable ({IUCN}) whale shark spans warm and temperate waters around the globe. However, their present-day and possible future global distribution has never been predicted. Using 30 years (1980-2010) of whale shark observations recorded by tuna purse-seiners fishing in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, we applied generalized linear mixed-effects models to test the hypothesis that similar environmental covariates predict whale shark occurrence in all major ocean basins. We derived global predictors from satellite images for chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature, and bathymetric charts for depth, bottom slope and distance to shore. We randomly generated pseudo-absences within the area covered by the fisheries, and included fishing effort as an offset to account for potential sampling bias. We predicted sea surface temperatures for 2070 using an ensemble of five global circulation models under a no climate-policy reference scenario, and used these to predict changes in distribution. The full model (excluding standard deviation of sea surface temperature) had the highest relative statistical support ({wAICc} = 0.99) and explained ca. 60\% of the deviance. Habitat suitability was mainly driven by spatial variation in bathymetry and sea surface temperature among oceans, although these effects differed slightly among oceans. Predicted changes in sea surface temperature resulted in a slight shift of suitable habitat towards the poles in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (ca. 5°N and 3-8°S, respectively) accompanied by an overall range contraction (2.5-7.4\% and 1.1-6.3\%, respectively). Predicted changes in the Pacific Ocean were small. Assuming that whale shark environmental requirements and human disturbances (i.e. no stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions) remain similar, we show that warming sea surface temperatures might promote a net retreat from current aggregation areas and an overall redistribution of the species. © 2013 John Wiley \&amp; Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between changes in land cover patterns and the Eurasian otter occurrence in southern Italy over the course of approximately 20 years (1985-2006) using multi-temporal species distribution models ({SDMs}). The study area includes five river catchments covering most of the otter's Italian range. Land cover and topographic data were used as proxies for the ecological requirements of the otter within a 300-m buffer around river courses. We used species presence, pseudo-absence data, and environmental predictors to build past (1985) and current (2006) {SDMs} by applying an ensemble procedure through the {BIOMOD} modeling package. The performance of each model was evaluated by measuring the area under the curve ({AUC}) of the receiver-operating characteristic ({ROC}). Multi-temporal analysis of species distribution was performed by comparing the maps produced for 1985 and 2006. The ensemble procedure provided good overall modeling accuracy, revealing that elevation and slope affected the otter's distribution in the past; in contrast, land cover predictors, such as cultivations and forests, were more important in the present period. During the transition period, 20.5\% of the area became suitable, with 76\% of the new otter presence data being located in these newly available areas. The multi-temporal analysis suggested that the quality of otter habitat improved in the past 20 years due to the expansion of forests and to the reduction of cultivated fields in riparian belts. This evidence stresses the great potential of riverine habitat restoration and environmental management in supporting the future expansion of the otter in Italy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Our goal is to build a preliminary framework for climate-mediated hominin dispersals in this understudied part of the Old World. Location: Tajikistan, Uzbekistan. Methods: We developed an ecological niche model using presence-only data to explain the spatial relationship of abiotic variables and hominin locations (n = 15) during glacial-interglacial transitions. The model was evaluated using the Cramér-von Mises goodness-of-fit statistic and empirical K-function. Results: Hominin locations were spatially aggregated during both glacial and interglacial periods. Of the abiotic variables analysed on a small scale (30-m resolution), only distance to water differed significantly between glacial and interglacial periods, although most locations were within 5 km of water. At a coarse scale (5-km resolution), hominin locations appear to have been constrained by low temperatures during glacial periods, but not during interglacials. Main conclusions: Hominin groups did not abandon Central Asia during colder periods. This suggests one of three possibly complementary scenarios: (1) late Pleistocene hominin groups had a more flexible behavioural repertoire than previously anticipated and were able to buffer climatic instability culturally; (2) our study area was not as hostile an environment as traditionally considered; and (3) the area examined here represents a refugium during late Pleistocene glaciations. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Combining different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich, but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative ({NeoMaps}) with historical distribution records to estimate potential changes in the distribution of eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species distribution model ({SDM}) estimating a historical maximum probability of occurrence for each species. We then used recent, {NeoMaps} survey data to build single-season occupancy models ({OM}) with the same environmental covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability, resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of probability of change in the state of occurrence. Our results suggested negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies. Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected, Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in detecting a high probability of change even for rare and patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability and representative sampling of its historical distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Areas providing security for vulnerable calves, and high food availability for lactating females can be critical habitats requiring specific conservation measures. Here, we test the hypothesis that calving and nursing habitat could be defined for Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus). We investigated the spatial and temporal preferences of this species around Pico Island, Azores, using data gathered from land-based surveys and dedicated at-sea observations between 2004 and 2007. We divided observed pods into three groups: (1) those with newborn and young calves, (2) those with older calves or juveniles and (3) those consisting only of adults or sub-adults. We analysed eco-geographical variables and incorporated them into a presence-only spatial distribution model to evaluate differences in habitat suitability among the groups. We identified 694 pods of Risso's dolphins overall. On the 267 pods observed in the first and second groups, 136 calves or juveniles were identified, of which 22 were newborns. The peak of the calving season was between June and August. The pods with newborn calves were larger and closer to shore, whereas the other groups were more widely dispersed offshore. Our results support the definition of critical habitat areas for this species, but we suggest widening the geographical coverage for better mapping around the island and throughout the archipelago generally.

This is particularly true for species whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses ({GSUA}) is a robust method to globally investigate the uncertainty of {SDMs} and the importance of species distributions' drivers in space and time.Here we apply {GSUA} to {MaxEnt} that is one of the popular presence-only {SDMs}. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) ({SP}) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution is evaluated for {MaxEnt}. {GSUA} is applied for three projections of the habitat (2006, 2060, and 2100) according to the A1B sea level rise scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease in habitat suitability in 2060 and 2100 prospecting a low risk of decline for the {SP}. The regularization parameter for the environmental features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh, transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of iterations for the model training are in this order the most important input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are related to the {SP} but, in general {MaxEnt} appears as a very non-linear model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input factors.The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, {GSUA} need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input factors of the model. {GSUA} allows quantitative informed species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by resource managers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

They are very sensitive to climate change and environmental pollution. Previous studies have focused largely on microhabitat preferences of epiphyllous liverworts and demonstrated the importance of climate factors such as humidity, temperature and light. However, little is known about the relationship between distribution of epiphyllous liverworts and macro-habitat factors at broad spatial scales. Here, we predicated the distribution of epiphyllous liverworts in China based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices at a 1 km spatial resolution using presence-only ecological niche models. We used the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve ({AUC}) and True Skill Statistic ({TSS}) to validate the models, and then used the Wilcoxon paired test to compare model performances. Furthermore, we applied the jackknife test to identify the important factors affecting predictions. Our results showed that the highest accuracy (i.e., {AUC} = 0.98 and {TSS} = 0.93) in predicting epiphyllous liverworts was achieved by the model that combined climatic and remotely sensed vegetation variables. The satellite-derived annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) as well as the annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Water Index ({NDWI}) emerged as the most important predictors of distribution patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, while climatic variables such as precipitation in the wettest quarter and temperature of the coldest quarter were of ancillary importance. The significant contributions of {NDVI} and {NDWI} in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, and the strong relationship between this species and evergreen forest implies that epiphyllous liverworts may be a useful indicator for forest degradation or integrity at broad spatial scales. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: Mexico. Methods: Phenological and statistical metrics were derived from remotely sensed time series data (2001-2009) of the Terra-{MODIS} enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature products. In a series of climatic and remote sensing-based {SDMs}, the distribution ranges of 40 species of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) were modelled based on presence-only herbarium and field data using the maximum entropy algorithm and summed to estimate species richness. Three different species-specific thresholds were applied to convert continuous model predictions into binary maps. Modelled species richness was compared to independent data from the Mexican National Forest Inventory. Results: The inclusion of remote sensing data led to significantly better predictions of species richness in comparison to the climate-based models for the summed suitabilities and all thresholds considered. Both climatic and remote sensing-based models allowed us to identify the areas with the highest pine species richness based on presence-only data. Remote sensing-based models compare closely with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and more detailed information on local habitat availability. Main conclusions: The results of this case study provide general guidance for the potential and limitations of using remote sensing data in S-{SDMs}. Our results confirmed that remote sensing data may not only have the capability for improving individual {SDMs}, but also can be a potential tool for reducing the overestimation of species richness by S-{SDMs}. This approach opens up new possibilities for species richness predictions in areas where biological survey data are scarce and where no species richness inventory data exist. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aim: Application of environmental envelope modelling ({EEM}) for conservation planning requires careful validation. Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate {EEM} because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations. Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent {EEM} software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve ({AUC}), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error. Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the {EEM} outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding {AUC}, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model. Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about {EEM} outcomes. This is encouraging, but {EEM} application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling.

	abstract = {Autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) poses significant challenges for forest managers. The ability to predict when and where this species will become a problem would allow managers to more effectively prioritize control efforts and implement the most efficient management practices available. Several studies have sought to determine which key factors lead to greater abundance of exotic, invasive plants on certain sites and their spread at multiple scales. Previous research suggests that disturbances and increased light can be important. The overall goal of this research was to identify factors associated with forest road edges that are most important in facilitating autumn olive. Specific objectives were to: (1) document site factors significantly related to the presence and success of autumn olive, (2) investigate the hypothesis that southern aspects have greater abundance, patch depth and growth of autumn olive than other aspects, (3) examine the hypothesis that there is a negative relationship between the abundance and height of autumn olive and the abundance and height of native species, and (4) determine if the relationship between autumn olive abundance and height and the abundance and height of other invasive species is positive. Densities of autumn olive, native woody species, and other woody exotic, invasive species in different size classes were quantified in plots located along forest-road edges having northern, southern, eastern, and western aspects. Slopes, elevation, road opening width, canopy cover, and basal area were also quantified at each plot location. In addition, presence and absence of autumn olive, slope, elevation, canopy cover, and road canopy closure were quantified at randomly selected points along major and minor gravel roads within the study area. Larger autumn olive were most abundant along edges with southern aspects and patches of autumn olive were deepest on edges with northern and southern aspects. Autumn olive height and abundance were positively related to the height and abundance of both native and exotic, invasive woody plants. Slope, elevation, road canopy cover, road opening width, and road type were found to be important factors influencing autumn olive establishment and success. As a result, these factors may prove useful in the development of habitat suitability models and {GIS}-based risk maps that managers could use to more effectively address this invasive species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Asian longhorned beetle ({ALB}) (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive insect pest that has established populations in Worcester County, Massachusetts as of 2008. {ALB} predominantly targets red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), which are prominent in New England hardwood forests, and Norway maple (Acer platanoides), which was planted in built environments as street trees in response to severe weather and invasive insect and pathogen disturbances. Mahalanobis Typicality models related presence locations of {ALB} presence-only locations in Worcester County towns from 2008 to 2012 to biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic variables to predict the potential distribution of {ALB} and to determine locations most characteristic of infestation. k-fold cross-validation and a continuous Boyce Index were employed to validate model performance and to identify threshold values at which continuous models of typicality could be reclassified into categorical maps. Distance-to-roads (r2=0.19) and probability of maple presence (r2=0.13) were the most important predictor variables in the {ALB} model. Locations that were most consistently susceptible to {ALB} infestation had significant high maple presence (p\&lt;0.001) and significant low distance-to-roads (p\&lt;0.001) compared to the whole study area, suggesting that {ALB} in Worcester County, {MA}, prefers maple-dominant edge habitats at the current stage of invasion. The localized {ALB} potential distribution model was consistently accurate (Boyce Continuous Index=0.84) despite the lack of absence locations and incomplete knowledge of {ALB} niche breadth in both native and invaded ranges. The results from this study could be used as a baseline for effective adaptive management policies that could help prioritize the need for early detection/eradication measures and address the potential ecological and social ramifications of the current {ALB} outbreak in Worcester County. It is hoped that the model employed could be further tested for future outbreaks as they are discovered in the {USA}. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The order Coelacanthiformes, once thought extinct, is much studied mainly because it contains species that share characteristics with lungfishes and tetrapods. Only a few years ago living specimens were discovered to science, and observations are so rare that the species are considered to be critically endangered. Observations include Latimeria chalumnae in deep waters of the coast of south eastern Africa while Latimeria menadoensis is known from similar habitats in Indonesian waters. Because of the interest around these enigmatic species, Ecological Niche Modelling techniques have been applied to estimate their distribution. The underlying assumption is that the environmental characteristics of the observation points are representative for the species. In this article we evaluate the difference in the output between the niche distributions produced by two expert systems and by two models based on Artificial Neural Networks. We evaluate the predictive behaviour of such models by focusing on L. chalumnae, as more observations are available for this species with respect to L. menadoensis. Finally, we assess the reliability of the maps by numerically evaluating the representativeness of the environmental characteristics in the observation locations, with respect to an area where the models show significant differences. This approach is different from previous ones because one of the expert systems is used to infer pseudo-absence points, that are successively employed to feed a Neural Network. One of the models based on this Neural Network is used to estimate the potential distribution and to produce a more extended map. The method promises to be applicable to other species with few observations, and allows to exploit the power of presenceset minusabsence based techniques. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated the impact and the interplay of future (2050) climate and land use change on plant diversity in Burkina Faso, which covers the major bioclimatic gradient in West Africa. Thus, regions with different levels of species richness can be investigated. The {LandSHIFT} model was adapted for this study to derive novel future (2050) land use simulations. One-class support vector machines ({SVMs}) were performed with these land use simulations together with current and future (2050) climate projections at a 0.1° resolution. Our modeling results show that the flora of Burkina Faso will be primarily negatively impacted by future climate and land use changes. However, we found contrasting latitudinal patterns. The more humid regions in Southern Burkina Faso would be more affected in terms of species loss than the Sahel. Climate change is more important than land use change under the assumption of technological stagnation in the agricultural sector. Our results suggest that, in general, the plant diversity in dry and humid regions of the tropics might respond differently to climate and land use change. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models ({HSMs}) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the {UK}. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development. We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in {NW} England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100 m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000 m, around each focal 50 or 100 m square. Presence-only {HSM} software, {MaxEnt}, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species. The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park. Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000 m). Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) that provide extrapolations of species habitat suitability are increasingly being used in stream ecosystems, however the effects of different modelling techniques on model projections remain unknown. We tested how different study areas and predictors affect {SDMs} by using consensus projections of a fixed set of 224 stream macroinvertebrate species and five algorithms implemented in {BIOMOD}/R. Four modelling designs were applied: (1) a landscape as a continuous study area without any discrimination between terrestrial and aquatic realms, (2) a stream network masked a posteriori from the previous design, (3) a stream network as the study area during the model-building stage, and (4) same as (3) but with a hydrologically corrected set of predictors. The true skill statistic ({TSS}) and accuracy of the consensus projections were not influenced by the different designs ({TSS} ranged from 0.80 to 1.00, accuracy ranged from 0.70 to 0.96). The projections of design (4) yielded a strong reduction in false positive predictions compared to (1) (on average by 56\%), (2) (11\%) or (3) (8\%).

	abstract = {Aim: Species distribution models have been widely used to tackle ecological, evolutionary and conservation problems. Most species distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be used confidently with presence-only data. Location: We used real spatially explicit environmental data derived from the western part of the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, and simulated species distributions within this area. Methods: Thirteen existing threshold selection methods were investigated mathematically to see whether the same threshold can be produced using either presence/absence data or presence-only data. We further adopted a simulation approach, created many virtual species with differing prevalences in a real landscape in south-eastern Australia, generated data sets with different proportions of pseudo-absences, built eight types of models with four modelling techniques, and investigated the behaviours of four threshold selection methods in these situations. Results: Three threshold selection methods were not affected by pseudo-absences, including max {SSS} (which is based on maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity), the prevalence of model training data and the mean predicted value of a set of random points. Max {SSS} produced higher sensitivity in most cases and higher true skill statistic and kappa in many cases than the other methods. The other methods produced different thresholds from presence-only data to those determined from presence/absence data. Main conclusions: Max {SSS} is a promising method for threshold selection when only presence data are available. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The stacking of species-distribution models (S-{SDMs}) is receiving attention by conservation researchers because this approach is capable of simultaneously predicting species richness and composition. However, the steps required to build S-{SDMs} implies at least two choices that influence its predictive performance which have not been extensively assessed: the selection of the modelling algorithm and the application of a threshold to transform the species-distribution models into binary maps to be added together to build the final S-{SDM}. Our goal was to provide guidelines concerning the best combinations of modelling algorithms and thresholds with which to build more accurate S-{SDMs}. We generated 380 S-{SDMs} of 1224 tree species in Mesoamerica by combining 19 distribution modelling methods with 20 different thresholds using presence-only data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We compared the predicted richness and composition with inventory data obtained from the {BIOTREE}-{NET} forest plot database. We designed two indicators of predictive performance that were based on the diversity factors used to measure species turnover: a (shared species between the observed and predicted compositions), b and c (the exclusive species of the predicted and observed compositions respectively) and compared them with the Sorensen and Beta-Simpson turnover measures. Our proposed indexes and the Sorensen index proved suitable as indicators of predictive performance for S-{SDMs}, whereas the Beta-Simpson turnover measure presented issues that would prevent its application to evaluate S-{SDMs}. Some modelling methods - especially machine learning and ensemble model forecasting methods performed significantly better than others in minimizing the error in predicted richness and composition. Our results also points out that restrictive thresholds (with high omission errors) lead to more accurate S-{SDMs} in terms of species richness and composition. Here, we demonstrate that particular combinations of modelling methods and thresholds provide results with higher predictive performance. These results provide clear modelling guidelines that will help S-{SDM} modellers to select the appropriate combination of modelling methods and thresholds to build more accurate S-{SDMs}, and therefore will have a positive impact on the quality of the diversity models used to assist conservation planning. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Recently, interest in species distribution modelling has increased following the development of new methods for the analysis of presence-only data and the deployment of these methods in user-friendly and powerful computer programs. However, reliable inference from these powerful tools requires that several assumptions be met, including the assumptions that observed presences are the consequence of random or representative sampling and that detectability during sampling does not vary with the covariates that determine occurrence probability. Based on our interactions with researchers using these tools, we hypothesized that many presence-only studies were ignoring important assumptions of presence-only modelling. We tested this hypothesis by reviewing 108 articles published between 2008 and 2012 that used the {MAXENT} algorithm to analyse empirical (i.e. not simulated) data. We chose to focus on these articles because {MAXENT} has been the most popular algorithm in recent years for analysing presence-only data. Many articles (87\%) were based on data that were likely to suffer from sample selection bias; however, methods to control for sample selection bias were rarely used. In addition, many analyses (36\%) discarded absence information by analysing presence-absence data in a presence-only framework, and few articles (14\%) mentioned detection probability. We conclude that there are many misconceptions concerning the use of presence-only models, including the misunderstanding that {MAXENT}, and other presence-only methods, relieve users from the constraints of survey design. In the process of our literature review, we became aware of other factors that raised concerns about the validity of study conclusions. In particular, we observed that 83\% of articles studies focused exclusively on model output (i.e. maps) without providing readers with any means to critically examine modelled relationships and that {MAXENT}'s logistic output was frequently (54\% of articles) and incorrectly interpreted as occurrence probability. We conclude with a series of recommendations foremost that researchers analyse data in a presence-absence framework whenever possible, because fewer assumptions are required and inferences can be made about clearly defined parameters such as occurrence probability. © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

The Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest ({UPAF}) of South America still holds the world's southernmost jaguar (Panthera onca) population. Our aims were: (i) to test several a priori hypotheses on the factors affecting jaguar persistence in this region, (ii) to map habitat suitability and identify areas with potentially conflicting habitat conditions, and (iii) to identify priority areas for management and improve the conservation initiatives for jaguars and the {UPAF}. Following an information-theoretic approach, we used presence records of jaguars and pseudo-absences in generalized linear models. We structured hypotheses into two groups which demand different management actions: land cover and human persecution. The best model of each group was used to develop a two-dimensional habitat model. Jaguar persistence was favoured by current and historical native forest cover, and hindered by human land uses. Protection favoured jaguar presence whereas human accessibility and high human population density had negative effects. The two-dimensional model suggests that \&lt;8\% (20,670km2) of the landscape represents potential core areas for jaguars (good land-cover characteristics and low human persecution) and 11.8\% (32,563km2) stands as potentially attractive sinks where good land-cover conditions conflict with high human persecution. Reduction of human persecution is urgently needed to increase the core areas for jaguars in this region, but improvement of land-cover conditions is important for sustaining the connectivity among jaguar populations that seem to be isolated in different areas of the {UPAF}. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented for producing these models. Specifically, 26 explanatory variables were used for the modelling; three versions of models were built using different sets of explanatory variables; pseudo-absences were chosen by filtering random points with a profile model; model accuracy was assessed using several measures, especially lift curve-related ones; a threshold was selected for each model to transform continuous result to binary one by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and (pseudo) specificity, which was proved to be valid for presence-only data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the analysis of forest resources, the use of {ALS} (airborne laser scanning) enables detailed three dimensional (3D) descriptions of forests and their vegetation. Simultaneously, ecologists have recognized that 3D information on vegetation is highly important in analyzing the habitat suitability of a given site. Recently, animals' habitat preferences have been analyzed, for example, with {GPS}-collared animals. This has resulted in detailed knowledge about the animals' movements both spatially and temporally. This study combines 3D information on vegetation obtained from {ALS} data with information about animal locations from {GPS} data. The aim was to map and analyze the habitat preferences of moose. The study area was located on the west coast of Finland. The data consisted of 18 {GPS}-collared moose (monitored from 2009 to 2010) and {ALS} data collected in 2010. We investigated how habitat structure changes as a function of distance to observed moose locations and how observed moose locations differ from randomly selected locations in terms of 3D structure. We also created a model-based habitat suitability map and tested it against moose occurrences. The results suggested that there are clear differences between the areas occupied and not occupied by moose and that these differences can be detected from {ALS} data. More importantly, {ALS} proved its potential in linking 3D descriptions of vegetation directly to observed moose locations without any proxy variables. These observations strongly support future studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The intra-seasonal adjustment in site selection, and hence in distribution of multi-brooded avian species, is a poorly investigated topic of potentially high relevance for conservation. This phenomenon may be especially important among multi-brooded species occurring in habitats undergoing large modifications. We used correlative species distribution models to carry out a spatially explicit assessment of variation in habitat suitability between early and late periods of the breeding season for four European farmland passerine species (woodlark Lullula arborea, skylark Alauda arvensis, cirl Emberiza cirlus and corn bunting E. calandra). We counted birds at transects (surveyed in early and late season) in Northern Apennines (Lombardy, Italy), and modelled their spatial distribution with {MaxEnt}, separately for early and late season periods. A comparison of predicted environmental suitability ({ES}) at occurrence sites showed significant differences between early and late period {ES} at both early and late occurrence sites. Three species showed differences in elevation between early and late occurrence sites. The proportion of 1-ha cells predicted as potentially suitable during the entire breeding season ranged from 29.3\% (corn bunting) to 52.8\% (woodlark) of the at least once suitable cells. In multi-brooded birds, a dynamic pattern of species occurrence may be likely and particularly important in farmland habitats along altitudinal gradients. The resulting within-season switches in habitat and distribution could be widespread among farmland birds and could have critical implications for their conservation. Moreover, such habitat switches provide an additional reason for preserving habitat heterogeneity. The intra-seasonal variation in habitat association/distribution should become a focal topic for researchers. Animal Conservation © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

	abstract = {Aim Two core assumptions of species distribution models ({SDMs}) do not hold when modelling invasive species. Invasives are not in equilibrium with their environment and niche quantification and transferability in space and time are limited. Here, we test whether combining global- and regional-scale data in a novel framework can overcome these limitations. Beyond simply improving regional niche modelling of non-native species, the framework also makes use of the violation of regional equilibrium assumptions, and aims at estimating the stage of invasion, range filling and risk of spread in the near future for 27 invasive species in the French Alps. Innovation For each invader we built three sets of {SDMs} using a committee averaging method: one global model and two regional models (a conventional model and one using the global model output to weight pseudo-absences). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, sensitivity and specificity scores. Then, we extracted the predictions for observed presences and compared them to global and regional models. This comparison made it possible to identify whether invasive species were observed within or outside of their regional and global niches. Main conclusions This study provides a novel methodological framework for improving the regional modelling of invasive species, where the use of a global model output to weight pseudo-absences in a regional model significantly improved the predictive performance of regional {SDMs}. Additionally, the comparison of the global and regional model outputs revealed distinct patterns of niche estimates and range filling among the species. These differences allowed us to draw conclusions about the stage of invasion and the risk of spread in the near future, which both correspond to experts' expectations. This framework can be easily applied to a large number of species and is therefore useful for control of biological invasions and eradication planning. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models ({SDMs}) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate {SDM} results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of {SDMs} using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, {USA}. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either {SDMs} built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency. © 2012.},

We estimate the contribution of multiple environmental parameters on the explanation of variation in abundance of cattle remains from archaeological sites, and find that annual precipitation and maximum annual temperature are significant predictors of abundance. We then formulate, test, and confirm a hypothesis that states the process of cattle domestication involves a change in the types of environmental ranges in which cattle exploitation occurred by applying a species distribution model to presence-only data of wild and domestic cattle.

	abstract = {Whale shark Rhincodon typus is a globally distributed species, but there is a lack of knowledge pertaining to their biology, seasonal occurrence, and distribution in the northern Gulf of Mexico ({NGOM}). Understanding critical habitat for whale sharks is essential on both a regional and global basis for proper management because of their large migratory range. The goal of the present study was to describe the regional distribution of whale shark feeding aggregations in the {NGOM} by exploiting a presence-only dataset collected as a part of a volunteer sighting survey. Whale shark aggregations have been documented in large numbers in the {NGOM} since 2003, and species distribution models provide a unique approach to analyzing these presence data. We used maximum entropy and ecological niche factor analysis, 2 algorithms designed for predicting spe cies distribution based only on presence data, to analyze data for the summer period in 2008 and 2009. Cohen's kappa (kappa) and the 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve' ({AUC}) were used to evaluate model performance with an external testing dataset. Kappa values ranged from 0.28 to 0.69, and {AUC} values ranged from 0.73 to 0.80, indicating that the predicted distribution had a fair to substantial agreement with the testing data. Distance to continental shelf edge, distance to adjacent petroleum platforms, and chlorophyll a were the variables most strongly related to whale shark sightings, likely due to an association of these variables with high food availability. Suitable habitat was predicted along the continental shelf edge, with the most suitable habitat predicted south of the Mississippi River Delta. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat is dynamic; therefore, a multi-year study is underway to better delineate temporal trends in regional whale shark distribution and to identify consistent areas of high suitability. Presenceonly habitat models are a powerful tool for delineating important regional habitat for a vulnerable, highly migratory species. © Inter-Research 2012.},

	abstract = {Managing forests for multiple objectives requires balancing timber and vegetation management objectives with needs of sensitive species. Especially challenging is how to retain the habitat elements for species that are typically associated with late-seral forests. We develop a regionally specific, multivariate model describing habitat selection that can be used - when linked to an institutional forest inventory program - to assess, monitor and forecast habitat conditions for a key wildlife species. We use the fisher (Martes pennanti) in northwestern California as our example and develop a predictive model for resting habitat that is created using data from the specific region where it will be used. We explore how this resting habitat model differs from a similar model developed for the Sierra Nevada and consider the implications for forest management. We developed the model using {MaxEnt} by comparing vegetation data at 99 randomly selected fisher resting structures on public and tribal lands in northwestern California with 883 Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA}) plots within the same ecoregion. A total of 58 alternative vegetation models were specified and the top 10 were nearly identical in their performance (Gain {\textgreater} 1.08; Area Under the Curve [{AUC}] {\textgreater} 0.89). We chose a five-variable model (canopy closure, tree age, total basal area, volume of " large" wood and basal area of hardwoods) because it included the fewest variables and included only those that could be affected by management. This model was similar to the Sierra Nevada model, but did not include topographic features (e.g., slope) nor did it include a variable representing the density of small trees. The absence of variables related to topography may make it easier for managers to affect positive change in resting habitat suitability since all variables can be influenced by management actions. Moreover, the model indicates that small trees appear to be less important (compared to southern Sierra Nevada) and therefore the probability of producing high-value resting habitat without higher fire risk is greater. We also created a spreadsheet that simplifies the process of generating habitat predictions from new data. Since metrics of stand structure and wildlife habitat are sensitive to sample design, collecting new data with {FIA} protocols will provide the most accurate estimates of predicted habitat with this model. Together, the Sierra Nevada and northwest California models provide managers in California a quantitative means to assess and monitor resting habitat suitability using current and future data that are part of an institutionally supported program to inventory forest vegetation. © 2012.},

	abstract = {1. Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest - the probability of occurrence (ψ). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate ψ from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that ψ is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices. © 2012 The Authors.

However, the frequently scarce and incomplete data owing to the sensitive nature of illegal activities pose a challenge to developing tools to properly understand and prevent those activities. 2.We used species distribution models to identify factors related to a prominent illegal activity, wildlife poisoning, and to produce detailed, spatially explicit maps of the risk of occurrence in {NW} Spain. We alleviated the constraints of imperfect information and occurrence of absences by using presence-only methods, that is, maximum entropy modelling ({MaxEnt}). To our knowledge, this is the first time that this method has been used in the context of illegal activities affecting wildlife. 3.A total of 112 poisoning events involving 228 individuals of 25 different species were reported in the study area from 2000 to 2010. Most of the reported deaths (90·8\%) were birds of prey (52·6\%) and mammalian carnivores (38·2\%), of which 95·2\% were scavengers. Illegal poisoning affected eleven species classified as endangered at national and/or global level. 4.Our models highlighted the perceived risk of livestock predation by wolves Canis lupus, although not by bears Ursus arctos, as a major motivation for poisoning. The existence of protected areas was positively correlated to this illegal practice, while socioeconomic factors had less influence on predicting its occurrence. Over 56\% of the study area was predicted to be under risk of illegal poisoning. 5.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a new use for presence-only models, illustrated using {MaxEnt}, to assist conservation managers dealing with illegal activities. This approach allows the main causes of an illegal practice to be identified and generates spatially explicit risk maps. Managers can take advantage of this modelling approach to allocate the scarce resources available in conservation to key sectors and locations. In our study system, actions against illegal poisoning should aim to resolve the potential conflict existing between cattle-farming and wolves, especially in protected areas. © 2012 The Authors.

	abstract = {1.Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2.In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3.When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4.Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques. © 2012 The Authors.

	abstract = {Aim The area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve ({AUC}) is a widely used statistic for assessing the discriminatory capacity of species distribution models. Here, I used simulated data to examine the interdependence of the {AUC} and classical discrimination measures (sensitivity and specificity) derived for the application of a threshold. I shall further exemplify with simulated data the implications of using the {AUC} to evaluate potential versus realized distribution models. Innovation After applying the threshold that makes sensitivity and specificity equal, a strong relationship between the {AUC} and these two measures was found. This result is corroborated with real data. On the other hand, the {AUC} penalizes the models that estimate potential distributions (the regions where the species could survive and reproduce due to the existence of suitable environmental conditions), and favours those that estimate realized distributions (the regions where the species actually lives). Main conclusions Firstly, the independence of the {AUC} from the threshold selection may be irrelevant in practice. This result also emphasizes the fact that the {AUC} assumes nothing about the relative costs of errors of omission and commission. However, in most real situations this premise may not be optimal. Measures derived from a contingency table for different cost ratio scenarios, together with the {ROC} curve, may be more informative than reporting just a single {AUC} value. Secondly, the {AUC} is only truly informative when there are true instances of absence available and the objective is the estimation of the realized distribution. When the potential distribution is the goal of the research, the {AUC} is not an appropriate performance measure because the weight of commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The need to understand the processes shaping population distributions has resulted in a vast increase in the diversity of spatial wildlife data, leading to the development of many novel analytical techniques that are fit-for-purpose. One may aggregate location data into spatial units (e.g. grid cells) and model the resulting counts or presence-absences as a function of environmental covariates. Alternatively, the point data may be modelled directly, by combining the individual observations with a set of random or regular points reflecting habitat availability, a method known as a use-availability design (or, alternatively a presence - pseudo-absence or case-control design). Although these spatial point, count and presence-absence methods are widely used, the ecological literature is not explicit about their connections and how their parameter estimates and predictions should be interpreted. The objective of this study is to recapitulate some recent statistical results and illustrate that under certain assumptions, each method can be motivated by the same underlying spatial inhomogeneous Poisson point process ({IPP}) model in which the intensity function is modelled as a log-linear function of covariates. The Poisson likelihood used for count data is a discrete approximation of the {IPP} likelihood. Similarly, the presence-absence design will approximate the {IPP} likelihood, but only when spatial units (i.e. pixels) are extremely small (Electric Journal of Statistics, 2010, 4, 1151-1201). For larger pixel sizes, presence-absence designs do not differentiate between one or multiple observations within each pixel, hence leading to information loss. Logistic regression is often used to estimate the parameters of the {IPP} model using point data. Although the response variable is defined as 0 for the availability points, these zeros do not serve as true absences as is often assumed; rather, their role is to approximate the integral of the denominator in the {IPP} likelihood (The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2010, 4, 1383-1402). Because of this common misconception, the estimated exponential function of the linear predictor (i.e. the resource selection function) is often assumed to be proportional to occupancy. Like {IPP} and count models, this function is proportional to the expected density of observations. Understanding these (dis-)similarities between different species distribution modelling techniques should improve biological interpretation of spatial models and therefore advance ecological and methodological cross-fertilization. © 2011 The Authors.

Species distribution modelling ({SDM}) could improve our knowledge and inform marine ecosystem management and conservation. Although marine environmental data are available from various sources, there are currently no user-friendly, high-resolution global datasets designed for {SDM} applications. This study aims to fill this gap by assembling a comprehensive, uniform, high-resolution and readily usable package of global environmental rasters. Location Global, marine. Methods We compiled global coverage data, e.g. satellite-based and in situ measured data, representing various aspects of the marine environment relevant for species distributions. Rasters were assembled at a resolution of 5 arcmin (c. 9.2km) and a uniform landmask was applied. The utility of the dataset was evaluated by maximum entropy {SDM} of the invasive seaweed Codium fragile ssp. fragile. Results We present Bio-{ORACLE} (ocean rasters for analysis of climate and environment), a global dataset consisting of 23 geophysical, biotic and climate rasters. This user-friendly data package for marine species distribution modelling is available for download at The high predictive power of the distribution model of C. fragile ssp. fragile clearly illustrates the potential of the data package for {SDM} of shallow-water marine organisms. Main conclusions The availability of this global environmental data package has the potential to stimulate marine {SDM}. The high predictive success of the presence-only model of a notorious invasive seaweed shows that the information contained in Bio-{ORACLE} can be informative about marine distributions and permits building highly accurate species distribution models. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Gridded climatologies have become an indispensable component of bioclimatic modelling, with a range of applications spanning conservation and pest management. Such globally conformal data sets of historical and future scenario climate surfaces are required to model species potential ranges under current and future climate scenarios. We developed a set of interpolated climate surfaces at 10′ and 30′ resolution for global land areas excluding Antarctica. Input data for the baseline climatology were gathered from the {WorldClim} and {CRU} {CL}1·0 and {CL}2·0 data sets. A set of future climate scenarios were generated at 10′ resolution. For each of the historical and future scenario data sets, the full set of 35 Bioclim variables was generated. Climate variables (including relative humidity at 0900 and 1500hours) were also generated in {CLIMEX} format. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification scheme was applied to the 10′ hybrid climatology as a tool for visualizing climatic patterns and as an aid for specifying absence or background data for correlative modelling applications. We tested the data set using a correlative model ({MaxEnt}) addressing conservation biology concerns for a rare Australian shrub, and a mechanistic niche model ({CLIMEX}) to map climate suitability for two invasive species. In all cases, the underlying climatology appeared to behave in a robust manner. This global climate data set has the advantage over the {WorldClim} data set of including humidity data and an additional 16 Bioclim variables. Compared with the {CRU} {CL}2·0 data set, the hybrid 10′ data set includes improved precipitation estimates as well as projected climate for two global climate models running relevant greenhouse gas emission scenarios. For many bioclimatic modelling purposes, there is an operational attraction to having a globally conformal historical climatology and future climate scenarios for the assessments of potential climate change impacts.

	abstract = {Whaling records from the mid-1800s provide the largest set of observations with which to conduct a basin-scale analysis of potential North Pacific right whale Eubalaena japonica habitat. Since these data lack the concurrent oceanographic data necessary to investigate the species' habitat characteristics I used ocean climate from a 20th century circulation model to create a suitable set of habitat predictors. My goals were to (1) identify regions of suitable habitat and (2) investigate the processes underlying the species-habitat relationship by (3) examining model performance at different spatial and temporal scales. The results show 2 non-overlapping habitat regions in the subarctic North Pacific, supporting the notion of 2 distinct subpopulations. The analysis also implicates surface temperature and temperature variability as strong indicators of potential right whale habitat. Tests of model performance at different scales strongly suggest that at the basin-scale, right whales use regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurs predictably from year to year). The significance of these indicators decreased at the regional scale emphasising the coupling of scale and process, and thus the need for different predictors at different scales. Comparisons of models built using different subsets of the dependent data showed how hypotheses can be tested and potential biases in observational data can be explored. Analyses of rare species' habitat such as this can provide guidance for more directed survey efforts and help identify areas and processes of potential biological importance. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {Although spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes and guiding conservation planning, studies combining a range of scales are rare. Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the {UK}, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the {UK} (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the {UK}. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Most species distribution models ({SDMs}) assume that habitats are closed, stable and without competition. In that environmental context, it is ecologically correct to assume that members of a species will be distributed in direct relation to the suitability of the habitat, that is, according to the so-called habitat matching rule. This paper examines whether it is possible to maintain the assumption of the habitat matching rule in the following circumstances: (1) when habitats are connected and organisms can move between them, (2) when there are disturbances and seasonal cycles that generate instability, and (3) when there is inter-specific and intra-specific competition. Here I argue that it is possible as long as the following aspects are taken into account. In open habitats at equilibrium, in which habitat selection and competition operate, the habitat matching rule can be applied in some conditions, while competition tends to homogenize the species distribution in other environmental contexts. In the latter case, two methods can be used to incorporate these effects into {SDMs}: new parameters can be incorporated into the response functions, or the occurrence of proportions of categories of individuals (adult/young, male/female, or dominant/subordinate species in guilds) can be used instead of the occurrence of organisms. The habitat matching rule is not fulfilled in non-equilibrium environments. The solution to this problem lies in the design of {SDMs} with two strategies that depend on scale. Locally, the disequilibrium can be encapsulated using average environmental conditions, with sufficiently large cells (in the case of metapopulations) and/or long enough sampling periods (in the case of seasonal cycles). At coarse scales, the use of presence-only models can in some cases avoid the destabilizing effect of catastrophic historical processes. The matching law is a strong assumption of {SDMs} because it is based on population ecology theory and the principle of evolution by natural selection. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Sierra Nevada red fox Vulpes vulpes necator is listed as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act. It originally occurred throughout California's Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain regions. Its current distribution is unknown but should be determined in order to guide management actions. We used occurrence data from the only known population, in the Lassen Peak region of northern California, combined with climatic and remotely sensed variables, to predict the species' potential distribution throughout its historic range. These model predictions can guide future surveys to locate additional fox populations. Moreover, they allow us to compare the relative performances of presence-absence (logistic regression) and presence-only (maximum entropy, or Maxent) modeling approaches using occurrence data with potential false absences and geographical biases. We also evaluated the recently revised Maxent algorithm that reduces the effect of geographically biased occurrence data by subsetting background pixels to match biases in the occurrence data. Within the Lassen Peak region, all models had good fit to the test data, with high values for the true skill statistic (76-83\%), percent correctly classified (86-92\%), and area under the curve (0.94-0.96), with Maxent models yielding slightly higher values. Outside the Lassen Peak region, the logistic regression model yielded the highest predictive performance, providing the closest match to the fox's historic range and also predicting a site where red foxes were subsequently detected in autumn 2010. Subsetting background pixels in Maxent reduced but did not eliminate the effect that geographically biased occurrence data had on prediction results relative to the Maxent model using full background pixels. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {In a world with poor biological inventorying and rapid land-use change, predicting the spatial distribution of species is fundamental for the effective management and conservation of threatened taxa. However, on a regional scale, predicting the distribution of rare terrestrial mammals is often unreliable and/or impractical, especially in tropical forests. We apply a recently developed analytic process that integrates density estimation (kernel smoothing), niche-analysis and geostatistics (regression-kriging) to model the occupancy and density distribution of a threatened population of white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari in a Brazilian Atlantic forest. Locations (n=45) within a protected area of the Serra-do-Mar state park were obtained from diurnal line transect census (233km), camera-trapping (751 camera-trap days) and surveys (\&gt;626km) conducted by park rangers. Niche modelling (environmental niche-factor analysis and {MAXENT}) revealed a restricted niche compared with the available habitat as defined by seven environmental variables. From the occupancy model obtained from regression-kriging, we found that 72\% of a 170km2 protected area is likely to be used by peccaries. We demonstrate that the distribution of large mammals can be restricted within continuous areas of Atlantic forest and therefore population estimates based on the size of protected areas can be overestimated. Our findings suggest that the generation of realized density distributions should become the norm rather than the exception to enable conservation managers and researchers to extrapolate abundance and density estimates across continuous habitats and protected areas. © 2011 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Predicting the geographic distribution of widespread species through modeling is problematic for several reasons including high rates of omission errors. One potential source of error for modeling widespread species is that subspecies and/or races of species are frequently pooled for analyses, which may mask biologically relevant spatial variation within the distribution of a single widespread species. We contrast a presence-only maximum entropy model for the widely distributed oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) that includes all available presence locations for this species, with two composite maximum entropy models. The composite models either subdivided the total species distribution into four geographic quadrants or by fifteen subspecies to capture spatially relevant variation in P. polionotus distributions.Results: Despite high Area Under the {ROC} Curve ({AUC}) values for all models, the composite species distribution model of P. polionotus generated from individual subspecies models represented the known distribution of the species much better than did the models produced by partitioning data into geographic quadrants or modeling the whole species as a single unit.Conclusions: Because the {AUC} values failed to describe the differences in the predictability of the three modeling strategies, we suggest using omission curves in addition to {AUC} values to assess model performance. Dividing the data of a widespread species into biologically relevant partitions greatly increased the performance of our distribution model; therefore, this approach may prove to be quite practical and informative for a wide range of modeling applications. © 2011 Gonzalez et al; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The wool carder bee, Anthidium manicatum, is the most widely distributed unmanaged bee in the world. It was unintentionally introduced to North America in the late 1960s from Europe, and subsequently, into South America, New Zealand and the Canary Islands. We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, {USA}. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and {MaxEnt} background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50\% of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability ({HS} ≥ 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214\% increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88\% decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D=0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D=0.69). We discuss the naturalization of A. manicatum in North America, possibly through punctuated dispersal, the probability of suitable habitats across the globe and the synanthropy exhibited by this invasive species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Comparing observed and modelled species distribution, we calculated the false absence rates, i.e. species wrongly modelled as absent, and the false presence rates, i.e. species wrongly modelled as present, on a 50 × 50km grid. Subsequently, we related both error rates to species range properties, land use and topographic variability within grid cells by means of simultaneous autoregressive models to correct for spatial autocorrelation. Results Grid-cell-specific error rates were not evenly distributed across Europe. The mean false absence rate was 0.16 ± 0.12 (standard deviation) and the mean false presence rate was 0.22 ± 0.13. False absence rates were highest in central Spain, the Alps and parts of south-eastern Europe, while false presence rates were highest in northern Spain, France, Italy and south-eastern Europe. False absence rates were high when range edges of species accumulated within a grid cell and when the intensity of human land use was high. False presence rates were positively associated with relative occurrence area and accumulation of range edges. Main conclusions Predictions for various species are not only accompanied by species-specific but also by grid-cell-specific errors. The latter are associated with characteristics of the grid cells but also with range characteristics of occurring species. Uncertainties of predictive species distribution models are not equally distributed in space, and we would recommend accompanying maps of predicted distributions with a graphical representation of predictive performance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of species distribution modelling is the choice of the modelling method because a suboptimal method may have poor predictive performance. Previous comparisons have found that novel methods, such as Maxent models, outperform well-established modelling methods, such as the standard logistic regression. These comparisons used training samples with small numbers of occurrences per estimated model parameter, and this limited sample size may have caused poorer predictive performance due to overfitting. Our hypothesis is that Maxent models would outperform a standard logistic regression because Maxent models avoid overfitting by using regularisation techniques and a standard logistic regression does not. Regularisation can be applied to logistic regression models using penalised maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation procedure shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, causing biased predictions if applied to the training sample but improving the accuracy of new predictions. We used Maxent and logistic regression (standard and penalised) to analyse presence/pseudo-absence data for 13 tree species and evaluated the predictive performance (discrimination) using presence-absence data. The penalised logistic regression outperformed standard logistic regression and equalled the performance of Maxent. The penalised logistic regression may be considered one of the best methods to develop species distribution models trained with presence/pseudo-absence data, as it is comparable to Maxent. Our results encourage further use of the penalised logistic regression for species distribution modelling, especially in those cases in which a complex model must be fitted to a sample with a limited size. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In all analyses we used a fixed study area, a fixed set of environmental predictors and a fixed set of presence observations. Next, we added pseudo-absence data generated by different sampling designs and in different numbers to assess their relative importance for the output from the species distribution model. The sampling design strongly influenced the predictive performance of the models while the number of pseudo-absences had minimal effect on the predictive performance. We attribute much of these results to the relationship between the environmental range of the pseudo-absences (i.e. the extent of the environmental space being considered) and the environmental range of the presence observations (i.e. under which environmental conditions the species occurs). The number of generated pseudo-absences had a direct effect on the predicted probability, which translated to different distribution areas. Pseudo-absence observations that fell within grid cells with presence observations were purposely included in our analyses. We discourage the practice of excluding certain pseudo-absence data because it involves arbitrary assumptions about what are (un)suitable environments for the species being modelled. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Aim The funnelweb spider Macrothele calpeiana is endemic to the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula, but recent occurrence records from localities in Spain, North Africa and other regions of Europe, which are distant from its native populations, suggest human-mediated dispersal, probably associated with the commercial export of olive trees. The main goal of this study was to assess the environmental suitability of these new records and to discuss the spider's potential to become an invasive species, mainly in new regions across Central Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Location Central Europe, Mediterranean Basin. Methods Using presence points from the Iberian native populations of M. calpeiana and a set of climatic variables, four presence-only algorithms ({BIOCLIM}, {DOMAIN}, {GARP} and Maxent) were applied to model the potential distribution of the spider. The models were transferred to Central Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and the locations of the new records in both the occupied and potential environmental spaces were screened. Results The four models were generally congruent in predicting the existence of a suitable climate for the species across the Mediterranean Basin, although {BIOCLIM} and {DOMAIN} yielded more constrained predictions than {GARP} and Maxent. Whereas the new records from Central Europe were located far from the occupied and potential climatic spaces, those from the Iberian Peninsula were not. Main conclusions Climatic suitability together with propagule pressure owing to human activities will certainly enhance the opportunities for M. calpeiana to colonize new areas across the Mediterranean Basin. The species has invaded areas beyond its native range, and those new locations located in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa show environmental suitability for the spider and deserve long-term monitoring. Although the new locations in Central Europe were not predicted by the climate models and the persistence of the species seems improbable, the possibility of rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity processes raises the need for caution over the possibility of a future spread of M. calpeiana across Europe. Stronger controls over the transport of trees must be applied, and further studies on the ecology of the spider are imperative to assess the possible impact on the invaded ecosystems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, species are driven to extinction at a high rate. To reduce this rate it is important to delineate suitable habitats for these species in such a way that these areas can be suggested as conservation areas. The use of habitat suitability models ({HSMs}) can be of great importance for the delineation of such areas. In this study {MaxEnt}, a presence-only modelling technique, is used to develop {HSMs} for 223 nematode species of the Southern Bight of the North Sea. However, it is essential that these models are beyond discussion and they should be checked for potential errors. In this study we focused on two categories (1) errors which can be attributed to the database such as preferential sampling and spatial autocorrelation and (2) errors induced by the modelling technique such as overfitting, In order to quantify these adverse effects thousands of nulls models were created. The effect of preferential sampling (i.e. some areas where visited more frequenty than others) was investigated by comparing model outcomes based from null models sampling the actual sampling stations and null models sampling the entire mapping area (Raes and ter Steege, 2007). Overfitting is exposed by a fivefold cross-validation and the influence of spatial autocorrelation is assessed by separating test and training sets in space. Our results clearly show that all these effects are present: preferential sampling has a strong effect on the selection of non-random species models. Crossvalidation seems to have less influence on the model selection and spatial autocorrelation is also strongly present. It is clear from this study that predefined thresholds are not readily applicable to all datasets and additional tests are needed in model selection. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Predicting the current and potential distributions of established invasive species is critical for evaluating management options, but methods for differentiating these distributions have received little attention. In particular, there is uncertainty among invasive species managers about the value of information from incidental sightings compared to data from designed field surveys. This study compares the two approaches, and develops a unifying framework, using the case of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in Victoria, Australia. 2.We first used 391 incidental sightings of sambar deer and 12 biophysical variables to construct a presence-only habitat suitability model using Maxent. We then used that model to stratify field sampling, with proportionately greater sampling of cells with high predicted habitat suitability. Field sampling, consisting of faecal pellet surveys, sign surveys and camera trapping, was conducted in 80 4-km 2 grid cells. A Bayesian state-space occupancy model was used to predict probability of suitable habitat from the field data. 3.The Maxent and occupancy models predicted similar spatial distributions of habitat suitability for sambar deer in Victoria and there was a strong positive correlation between the rankings of cells by the two approaches. The congruence of the two models suggests that any spatial and detection biases in the presence-only data were relatively unimportant in our study. 4.We predicted the extent of suitable habitat from the occupancy model using a threshold that gave a false negative error rate of 0.05. The current distribution was the suitable habitat within a kernel that had a 99.5\% chance of including the presence locations pooled from incidental sightings and field surveys: the potential distribution was suitable habitat outside that kernel. Several discrete areas of potential distribution were identified as priorities for surveillance monitoring with the aim of detecting and managing incursions of sambar deer. 5.Synthesis and applications.Our framework enables managers to robustly estimate the current and potential distributions of established invasive species using either presence-only and/or presence-absence data. Managers can then focus control and/or containment actions within the current distribution and establish surveillance monitoring to detect incursions within the potential distribution. © 2010 The Authors.

	abstract = {The abundance and distribution of a species are affected by processes which operate at multiple scales. Large-scale dynamics are increasingly recognized in conservation responses such as metapopulation management, transfrontier protected areas and softening the agricultural matrix. Landscape-scale monitoring is needed both to inform and judge their efficacy. In this Special Profile we address some of the challenges presented by monitoring at the landscape scale, how models of species distribution can be used to inform policy, and we discuss how monitoring at the global-scale could be approached. 2.Collecting data over a large area is inherently costly, so methods which can provide robust information at low-cost are particularly valuable. We present two papers which test low-cost approaches against more data-hungry methods (indices of abundance vs. direct density estimates, and species distribution models built from presence-only vs. presence/absence data). 3.Occupancy modelling is a useful approach for landscape-scale monitoring due to the relatively low-cost of collecting detection/non-detection data. We discuss challenges, such as non-random sampling locations and periodical unavailability for detection, in using detection/non-detection data for monitoring species distribution. Such data can also provide estimates of abundance and we show how existing models have been modified to allow the abundance of multiple species to be estimated simultaneously. 4.Models of species distribution can be used to project likely future scenarios and thus inform conservation planning where distributions are likely to change because of climate change or changing disturbance patterns. We also discuss how an optimization framework can be used to make efficient management decisions for invasive species management in the light of imperfect information. 5.Synthesis and applications. Monitoring is needed for many purposes including auditing past management decisions and informing future choices. Much monitoring data are collected at the site scale, although management authorities increasingly recognize landscape-scale dynamics. Recent global targets for conservation require monitoring which can report trends at the global-scale. Integrating data collected at a variety of scales to draw robust inference at the scale required is a challenge which deserves more attention from applied ecologists. © 2011 The Author.

	abstract = {Winter feeding has become a critical approach to sustain animals in high latitude, but little literature has investigated possible side-effects in terms of ecological niches. To explore whether winter feeding might affect species distributions at regional scale, we employed a novel spatial model, Mahalanobis Distances Factor Analysis, in the case of Red-crowned Cranes (Grus japonensis) in Hokkaido, Japan. This model features better prediction ability with more explicit ecological significance compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, particularly innovative is that axes are used to define ecological niches, with a minimal set of habitual variables to calculate habitat suitability in the algorithm. In results, winter feeding seemed to considerably impact the distributions, suggesting heavy dependence of human food supplies of the focal species. Besides, most of the other human influence variables, such as human population and road, tended to be relatively less associated with the occurrence localities, implying decreased sensitivity to human proximity. Taken together, the focal species might possibly survive in the adverse climate at the cost of diminished innate ability. In other words, winter feeding could impair the ability of self-sustaining in the wilderness, which can also take place but may remain hidden in similar cases around the globe. Contingency plans should thus be considered to minimize the side-effects of winter feeding for effective biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) can provide useful information for managing biological invasions, such as identification of priority areas for early detection or for determining containment boundaries. However, prediction of invasive species using {SDMs} can be challenging because they typically violate the core assumption of being at equilibrium with their environment, which may lead to poorly guided management resulting from high levels of omission. Our goal was to provide a suite of potential decision strategies ({DSs}) that were not reliant on the equilibrium assumption but rather could be chosen to better match the management application, which in this case was to ensure containment through adequate surveillance. We used presence-only data and expert knowledge for model calibration and presence/absence data to evaluate the potential distribution of an introduced mesquite (Leguminoseae: Prosopis) invasion located in the Pilbara Region of northwest Western Australia. Five different {DSs} with varying levels of conservatism/risk were derived from a multi-criteria evaluation model using ordered weighted averaging. The performance of {DSs} over all possible thresholds was examined using receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis. {DSs} not on the convex hull of the {ROC} curves were discarded. Two threshold determination methods ({TDMs}) were compared on the two remaining {DSs}, one that assumed equilibrium (by maximizing overall prediction success) and another that assumed the invasion was ongoing (using a 95\% threshold for true positives). The most conservative {DS} fitted the validation data most closely but could only predict 75\% of the presence data. A more risk-taking {DS} could predict 95\% of the presence data, which identified 8.5 times more area for surveillance, and better highlighted known populations that are still rapidly invading. This {DS} and {TDM} coupling was considered to be the most appropriate for our management application. Our results show that predictive niche modeling was highly sensitive to risk levels, but that these can be tailored to match specified management objectives. The methods implemented can be readily adapted to other invasive species or for conservation purposes. © 2010.},

We investigated the potential of compiled ecological data in developing habitat models for Macadamia integrifolia, a vulnerable mid-stratum tree endemic to lowland subtropical rainforests of southeast Queensland, Australia. We compared performance of two binomial models-Classification and Regression Trees ({CART}) and Generalised Additive Models ({GAM})-with Maximum Entropy ({MAXENT}) models developed from (i) presence records and available absence data and (ii) developed using presence records and background data. The {GAM} model was the best performer across the range of evaluation measures employed, however all models were assessed as potentially useful for informing in situ conservation of M. integrifolia, A significant loss in the amount of M. integrifolia habitat has occurred (p{\textless} 0.05), with only 37\% of former habitat (pre-clearing) remaining in 2003. Remnant patches are significantly smaller, have larger edge-to-area ratios and are more isolated from each other compared to pre-clearing configurations (p{\textless} 0.05). Whilst the network of suitable habitat patches is still largely intact, there are numerous smaller patches that are more isolated in the contemporary landscape compared with their connectedness before clearing. These results suggest that in situ conservation of M. integrifolia may be best achieved through a landscape approach that considers the relative contribution of small remnant habitat fragments to the species as a whole, as facilitating connectivity among the entire network of habitat patches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We modelled the potential distribution in Portugal of one of the rarest European bats Barbastella barbastellus and subsequently ground-validated predictions by using acoustic transects. We used ecological niche factor analysis ({ENFA}) and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling to build distribution models of B. barbastellus, and determined which ecological factors were more relevant for each model. As {ENFA} only accepts continuous variables, we built one Maxent model using the same variables as {ENFA} and another using land cover as a categorical variable. Ecological niche factor analysis and both Maxent models predicted similar areas of occurrence in central and northern regions of Portugal, although {ENFA} predicted suitable habitat over a wider range. Conversely, there was substantial disagreement on the location of high-suitability areas in the south. This could be a consequence of a different choice of important variables made by each model. Native woodland and average temperature were the most relevant variables for Maxent, while in {ENFA} B. barbastellus was linked to higher altitudes although avoiding production forests and infrastructures. Threshold-independent and -dependent statistics showed that Maxent models outperformed {ENFA}, probably as a consequence of divergent predictions in the new areas of occurrence. Overall, 15 new B. barbastellus sites were discovered and known distribution was extended c. 100 km to the south. Synthesis and applications. Our results support the use of presence-only modelling as an indispensible tool for survey design as shown by the discovery of B. barbastellus populations outside of the previously known range. {ENFA} seems to be more suited to determining a species' potential distribution, although failing to extrapolate it. In contrast, Maxent is better suited to determining a species' realized distribution. It was successful in predicting occurrence in previously unsurveyed areas and can be recommended as a technique for determination of a conservative distribution for a species. Maxent modelling would greatly aid biodiversity conservation, especially when it is necessary to develop survey plans or first assessments of a species' distribution. © 2010 The Authors.

	abstract = {Identifying those areas suitable for recolonization by threatened species is essential to support efficient conservation policies. Habitat suitability models ({HSM}) predict species' potential distributions, but the quality of their predictions should be carefully assessed when the species-environment equilibrium assumption is violated. We studied the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, whose numbers are recovering in southern Italy. To produce widely applicable results, we chose standard {HSM} procedures and looked for the models' capacities in predicting the suitability of a recolonization area. We used two fieldwork datasets: presence-only data, used in the Ecological Niche Factor Analyses ({ENFA}), and presence-absence data, used in a Generalized Linear Model ({GLM}). In addition to cross-validation, we independently evaluated the models with data from a recolonization event, providing presences on a previously unoccupied river. Three of the models successfully predicted the suitability of the recolonization area, but the {GLM} built with data before the recolonization disagreed with these predictions, missing the recolonized river's suitability and badly describing the otter's niche. Our results highlighted three points of relevance to modelling practices: (1) absences may prevent the models from correctly identifying areas suitable for a species spread; (2) the selection of variables may lead to randomness in the predictions; and (3) the Area Under Curve ({AUC}), a commonly used validation index, was not well suited to the evaluation of model quality, whereas the Boyce Index ({CBI}), based on presence data only, better highlighted the models' fit to the recolonization observations. For species with unstable spatial distributions, presence-only models may work better than presence-absence methods in making reliable predictions of suitable areas for expansion. An iterative modelling process, using new occurrences from each step of the species spread, may also help in progressively reducing errors. Synthesis and applications. Conservation plans depend on reliable models of the species' suitable habitats. In non-equilibrium situations, such as the case for threatened or invasive species, models could be affected negatively by the inclusion of absence data when predicting the areas of potential expansion. Presence-only methods will here provide a better basis for productive conservation management practices. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {We present and evaluate {AquaMaps}, a presence-only species distribution modelling system that allows the incorporation of expert knowledge about habitat usage and was designed for maximum output of standardized species range maps at the global scale. In the marine environment there is a significant challenge to the production of range maps due to large biases in the amount and location of occurrence data for most species. {AquaMaps} is compared with traditional presence-only species distribution modelling methods to determine the quality of outputs under equivalently automated conditions. The effect of the inclusion of expert knowledge to {AquaMaps} is also investigated. Model outputs were tested internally, through data partitioning, and externally against independent survey data to determine the ability of models to predict presence versus absence. Models were also tested externally by assessing correlation with independent survey estimates of relative species abundance. {AquaMaps} outputs compare well to the existing methods tested, and inclusion of expert knowledge results in a general improvement in model outputs. The transparency, speed and adaptability of the {AquaMaps} system, as well as the existing online framework which allows expert review to compensate for sampling biases and thus improve model predictions are proposed as additional benefits for public and research use alike. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We here examine species distribution models for a Neotropical anuran restricted to ombrophilous areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot. We extend the known occurrence for the treefrog Hypsiboas bischoffi (Anura: Hylidae) through {GPS} field surveys and use five modeling methods ({BIOCLIM}, {DOMAIN}, {OM}-{GARP}, {SVM}, and {MAXENT}) and selected bioclimatic and topographic variables to model the species distribution. Models were first trained using two calibration areas: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest ({BAF}) and the whole of South America ({SA}). All modeling methods showed good levels of predictive power and accuracy with mean {AUC} ranging from 0.77 ({BIOCLIM}/{BAF}) to 0.99 ({MAXENT}/{SA}). {MAXENT} and {SVM} were the most accurate presence-only methods among those tested here. All but the {SVM} models calibrated with {SA} predicted larger distribution areas when compared to models calibrated in {BAF}. {OM}-{GARP} dramatically overpredicted the species distribution for the model calibrated in {SA}, with a predicted area around 106 km2 larger than predicted by other {SDMs}. With increased calibration area (and environmental space), {OM}-{GARP} predictions followed changes in the environmental space associated with the increased calibration area, while {MAXENT} models were more consistent across calibration areas. {MAXENT} was the only method that retrieved consistent predictions across calibration areas, while allowing for some overprediction, a result that may be relevant for modeling the distribution of other spatially restricted organisms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {From the Publisher:In the 1990s, a new type of learning algorithm was developed, based on results from statistical learning theory: the Support Vector Machine ({SVM}). This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of {SVMs}-kernels--for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. Learning with Kernels provides an introduction to {SVMs} and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years.},

	abstract = {Many studies have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of plant species, but few have attempted to constrain projections through plant dispersal limitations. Instead, most studies published so far have simplified dispersal as either unlimited or null. However, depending on the dispersal capacity of a species, landscape fragmentation, and the rate of climatic change, these assumptions can lead to serious over- or underestimation of the future distribution of plant species.To quantify the discrepancies between simulations accounting for dispersal or not, we carried out projections of future distribution over the 21st century for 287 mountain plant species in a study area of the western Swiss Alps. For each species, simulations were run for four dispersal scenarios (unlimited dispersal, no dispersal, realistic dispersal, and realistic dispersal with long-distance dispersal events) and under four climate change scenarios.Although simulations accounting for realistic dispersal limitations did significantly differ from those considering dispersal as unlimited or null in terms of projected future distribution, the unlimited dispersal simplification did nevertheless provide good approximations for species extinctions under more moderate climate change scenarios. Overall, simulations accounting for dispersal limitations produced, for our mountainous study area, results that were significantly closer to unlimited dispersal than to no dispersal. Finally, analysis of the temporal pattern of species extinctions over the entire 21st century revealed that important species extinctions for our study area might not occur before the 2080–2100 period, due to the possibility of a large number of species shifting their distribution to higher elevation.},

	abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement ({NRI}), and integrated discrimination improvement ({IDI}). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

	abstract = {A computational framework to map species’ distributions (realized density) using occurrence-only data and environmental predictors is presented and illustrated using a textbook example and two case studies: distribution of root vole (Microtes oeconomus) in the Netherlands, and distribution of white-tailed eagle nests (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Croatia. The framework combines strengths of point pattern analysis (kernel smoothing), Ecological Niche Factor Analysis ({ENFA}) and geostatistics (logistic regression-kriging), as implemented in the spatstat, adehabitat and gstat packages of the R environment for statistical computing. A procedure to generate pseudo-absences is proposed. It uses Habitat Suitability Index ({HSI}, derived through {ENFA}) and distance from observations as weight maps to allocate pseudo-absence points. This design ensures that the simulated pseudo-absences fall further away from the occurrence points in both feature and geographical spaces. The simulated pseudo-absences can then be combined with occurrence locations and used to build regression-kriging prediction models. The output of prediction are either probabilitiesy of species’ occurrence or density measures. Addition of the pseudo-absence locations has proven effective — the adjusted R-square increased from 0.71 to 0.80 for root vole (562 records), and from 0.69 to 0.83 for white-tailed eagle (135 records) respectively; pseudo-absences improve spreading of the points in feature space and ensure consistent mapping over the whole area of interest. Results of cross validation (leave-one-out method) for these two species showed that the model explains 98\% of the total variability in the density values for the root vole, and 94\% of the total variability for the white-tailed eagle. The framework could be further extended to Generalized multivariate Linear Geostatistical Models and spatial prediction of multiple species.

	abstract = {Species distribution models should provide conservation practioners with estimates of the spatial distributions of species requiring attention. These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, {GARP}, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and {GARP}) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox.},

Even though there are many approaches to determining thresholds, there is no comparative study. In this paper, twelve approaches were compared using two species in Europe and artificial neural networks, and the modelling results were assessed using four indices: sensitivity, specificity, overall prediction success and Cohen's kappa statistic. The results show that prevalence approach, average predicted probability/suitability approach, and three sensitivity-specificity-combined approaches, including sensitivity-specificity sum maximization approach, sensitivity-specificity equality approach and the approach based on the shortest distance to the top-left corner (0,1) in {ROC} plot, are the good ones. The commonly used kappa maximization approach is not as good as the afore-mentioned ones, and the fixed threshold approach is the worst one. We also recommend using datasets with prevalence of 50\% to build models if possible since most optimization criteria might be satisfied or nearly satisfied at the same time, and therefore it's easier to find optimal thresholds in this situation.},

This, together with developments in geographical information systems and statistical methods, has enabled scientists to calculate, for thousands of species, the environmental conditions of their distributional areas. The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton’s tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.
